TRUE,Student 46,"I say the answer is b because we know force and acceleration have the same direction according to Newton's Second Law, so if the net force of the box is going in the positive x-direction, so will acceleration.

TRUE,Student 100,"The net force and the acceleration are both vectors, and according to Newton's Second Law, F=ma, which means that net force and the acceleration must move in the same direction. Thus, since the net force is in the positive x position, the acceleration is also in the positive x direction. However, the velocity doesn't relate to the net force and the acceleration (which is the change of the velocity), so it could point at any position while the net force is in the positive x direction.",2,"(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)",1,33:51

FALSE,Student 96,"Since force causes acceleration, then a net force acting on a box in the positive x-direction would cause the box to accelerate in this same direction because it is directly being subjected to the net force. I'm pretty sure the velocity would also be parallel to the x-axis but I was more confused about this part. My guess would be that since the net force is in the direction to the positive x-direction and the net acceleration is in the same direction, then the velocity would have to also be moving in that direction making it parallel to the x-axis.",3,"(1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1)",0,35:35
FALSE,Student 68,Let's say the positive x direction is the right. The box could be speeding up to the right in which case both its velocity and acceleration would be pointing to the positive x direction. The box could also be moving to the negative x direction before another force is exerted on in and since the net force is pos x direction the velocity is still moving to the pos x direction but since the box is slowing down the acc is in the negative x direction. Either way the velocity and acceleration are both parallel to the x axis.,3,"(1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0)",0,39:49
FALSE,Student 41,The velocity is parallel to the x-axis because whereever the direction of the poitive x is going the box is going to be moving with it making it parallel to the direction that it is getting pushed.

TRUE,Student 18,"The acceleration would be parallel to the x-axis because the force causes the acceleration, and like the video explains, the direction of the force and acceleration are always the same.

TRUE,Student 5,"Since F = ma, force in the x-direction would mean that the acceleration would have to be moving directly in the x-direction as well, or else the force wouldn't be in the positive x-direction.
