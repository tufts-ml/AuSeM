TRUE,Student 21,"Velocity is increasing at a parabolic rate, so acceleration must be linear",1,"(0,0,0,0,0,0,0)",1,29:31,
TRUE,Student 70,"1. I can see from the second graph that as velocity is decreasing before t reaches 0, it does so at a continuously slower rate, which can be seen in the gradual flattening of the curve, meaning that the acceleration is positive. Only the correct option for the graph of the acceleration curve shows the acceleration curve increasing when t is less than 0. 2. I recognize the first graph as x(t)=t^3. Thus, v(t)=(d(t^3))/dt which works out to v(t)=t^2, also clearly shown in the graph. Doing the same thing for acceleration, a(t)=t, the graph of which is the one I chose.",1,"(0,0,0,0,0,0,1)",1,42:40,
TRUE,Student 79,"The acceleration function is simply rewritten as the derivative of the velocity function. Therefore, the graph for a(t) is the values of the slopes of the v(t) curve at each point. On the velocity curve, the slopes progressively increase (get closer to 0) but are negative, and then increase and are positive. This exactly matches the acceleration line, it increases the entire time but starts off negative and ends up positive.",1,"(0,0,0,0,0,0,1)",1,31:55,
TRUE,Student 74,"just looking at the velocity graph, the velocity is decreasing (neg acceleration) and then increasing (positive acceleration)",1,"(0,0,0,0,0,0,1)",0,32:51,
TRUE,Student 5,"The answer is a because the velocity graph is decreasing when x<0, so acceleration would be negative, and then increasing when x>0, so acceleration would be positive.",1,"(0,0,0,0,0,0,1)",0,20:58,
TRUE,Student 18,"Since the graph of acceleration over time is the slope of velocity over time, I looked at the slope of the velocity graph. It shows that velocity has a negative slope when x is less than 0 and a positive slope when x is more than zero. The first acceleration graph (which resembles a graph of y = x) corresponds to this because the y values (acceleration at specific times) are negative left of the origin and positive right of the origin.",1,"(0,0,0,0,0,0,1)",1,,
TRUE,Student 19,"The displacement graph is showing that it starts out below, and then looking at the derivative, or instantaneous speed, is slowing down around zero, and then speeding up again. The first acceleration curve makes the most sense, because acceleration is starting negatively, and then getting less negative, then hitting zero, and then becoming more positive, aka speeding up.",1,"(0,0,0,0,0,1,1)",1,21:29,
