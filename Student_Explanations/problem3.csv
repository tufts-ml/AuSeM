TRUE,Student 96,"Since the dog and the girl are both on the reference frame of the conveyer belt, the speed at which the conveyer belt is moving is irrelevant in this situation. Therefore, the dog is still running toward the girl at a velocity of 8 m/s.",2,"(1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0)",0,17:29
TRUE,Student 56,"The speed of the dog relative to the girl is 8 m/s. The speed of the dog relative to the belt is 8 m/s and the speed of the belt relative to the girl is 0 m/s (because the girl stands on the belt, moving at the same velocity as the belt moves with respect to the ground). When those are added together, it results in 8 m/s.",2,"(1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0)",1,40:16
TRUE,Student 50,The girl is not moving so her velocity is 0 m/s. The dog then is moving 8m/s toward the girl regardless of the velocity of the belt.,2,"(1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0)",0,37:27

TRUE,Student 10,The dog and the girl are both on the conveyor belt. The velocity of the dog would be equal to the velocity of the dog with respect to the belt and the belt with respect to the girl. The girl is standing still which would be a vector of magnitude 0 plus the dog's velocity vector os 8 m/s to the left which gives 8 m/s to the left.,2,"(1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0)",1,38:40

TRUE,Student 59,I'm having a hard time deciding between 6 and 8m/s but thinking about the elevator problem we did from inside the elevator the ball was moving the same as it would be if there was no elevator so i assume for this problem the same logic applies that since the lady is on the belt then the dogs speed should remain similar to how it would be if the belt wasnt there. the reason im still caught on 6m/s a little bit is because just like in the first part the dog is still running against the belt just like how earlier the girl was swimming against the current,2,"(1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0)",0,25:05
TRUE,Student 94,"The girl is at rest on the moving walkway; for the purposes of evaluating movement, she is essentially an extension of the belt. The dog's speed relative to her is the same as its speed relative to the belt.",2,"(1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0)",0,16:14
TRUE,Student 11,There would be no change in velocity of the dog on the conveyor belt along with the girl. They are both in the frame as well for this reason.,2,"(1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0)",0,01:23
TRUE,Student 79,"Relative to the girl, the dog is moving at a speed of 8 meters per second. This was was really tricky to understand at first, because the first thing that comes to my mind is including the speed of the belt. What's so important to understand is that relative to the belt, the girl is not moving. She's staying still relative to the belt while the dog is moving at a velocity of 8 meters per second in the opposite direction relative to the belt. Both the dog and the girl are on the moving belt, so this speed will not affect the velocity of the dog relative to the girl. So, if the girl is not moving (in relativity to the belt) and has a velocity of 0 m/s and the dog is moving at a speed of 8 m/s in relation to the belt, we can conclude that the dog is moving at a speed of 8 meters per second relative to the girl.",2,"(1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0)",0,49:46

TRUE,Student 57,"The girl's velocity is 0 m/s. So when we subtract 8 m/s by 0 m/s, we get 8 m/s. This makes sense because both the dog and the girl are unfazed by the velocity of the belt so the only relative speed they witness is that of each other's",2,"(1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0)",1,47:12
TRUE,Student 61,"The girl and the dog are getting closer. The girl is moving closer to the dog at 2 m/s and the dog is moving closer to the girl at 6 m/s. Therefore, from the perspective of the girl, the dog is moving 8 m/s. 6 m/s + 2 m/s = 8 m/s.",2,"(1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0)",1,35:27

FALSE,Student 13,The dog is moving in the direction of the girl and the girl is moving the direction of the dog because the belt is moving the same way. So I added the dog's speed to the speed of the belt as that is what the girl will see when she sees the dog.,3,"(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0)",1,38:38
TRUE,Student 7,"At first, I thought the dog would be moving 10 m/s relative to the girl (adding 2 m/s to 8 m/s). Then I realized the girl is not moving relative to the belt, so, from her perspective, the dog is only moving 8 m/s.",2,"(1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1)",0,27:24
TRUE,Student 60,"The dog and the girl are both on the belt, so its movement in relation to the ground can be ignored.

TRUE,Student 75,"Relative to the walkway, the girl is stationary: she is only moving where the walkway moves her.
