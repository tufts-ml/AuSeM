It shows the slope of the given velocity,0,Student 47
"Acceleration is equal to the rate of change in velocity. On the left side of the graph, the velocity is decreasing, so the acceleration is negative. On the right side of the graph, the velocity is increasing, so the acceleration is positive.",0,Student 51
"The velocity graph shows a negative derivative until 0 then is positive after that, and only the second picture shows that",0,Student 43
"acceleration is the derivative of velocity. Since the velocity graph is a parabola, the acceleration graph has to be linear because the derivative of a parabola is a straight line.",0,Student 59
"Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, so a graph showing the acceleration curve would resemble a graph of the derivative of the velocity graph. In this case, the velocity graph is a parabola, so its derivative would be a linear function, not one of absolute value (the other option).",0,Student 58
"I mainly looked at the velocity graph and determined the sign for the slopes before and after t=0. When t<0, its slope (acceleration, which is change in velocity per unit of time) is <0. When t>0, its slope is >0. Therefore, when transferring this on an acceleration vs. time graph, the acceleration values at t<0 will be negative, and the acceleration values at t>0 will be positive. The second option for this answer would indicate that the acceleration is always positive, which is not the case. Therefore, I believe the first option is correct.",0,Student 48
"Since acceleration is the derivative of velocity, then the graph would have to be a positive linear model. Option two does not work because there are negative slopes in the velocity graph, and these are shown on the option I chose.",0,Student 46
"I chose A because acceleration defines how velocity changes with time which is basically how the slope of the velocity curve is changing with time, hence the notation d v(t)/dt. The diagram in A shows the correct transition of the slope of the velocity curve from being negative to positive.",0,Student 45
"Referring back to my notes, acceleration is how fast the velocity is changing, which also means the derivative of the velocity is acceleration. If one were to take the derivative of the velocity graph shown, one would get a graph looking like option B.",0,Student 53
"As we can see in the velocity graph, v = 0 as it approaches 0 from the left. Here the acceleration is negative and has a negative slope, as shown in plot A. The velocity then increases, indicating the object is speeding up and having a positive acceleration.",0,Student 50
I choose this answer because the displacement was becoming exponentially negative,0,Student 49
"The answer is a because the velocity graph is decreasing when x<0, so acceleration would be negative, and then increasing when x>0, so acceleration would be positive.",0,Student 5
The initial velocity is the same and the only force on the ball is gravity which is constant.,1,Student 47
Both balls are in freefall and are only being influenced by gravity so they will both experience the same downward acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2,1,Student 59
"Since gravity has the same effect on both balls, both balls have the same vertical acceleration. The first ball was launched horizontally, meaning both balls have an initial vertical velocity of 0 and will reach the ground at the same time.",1,Student 51
"The balls will hit the ground at the same time because they both start off with an initial velocity of zero. As the balls are launched off, gravity acts on the balls forcing them to go downwards. They have the same acceleration downwards and therefore will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 6
"The horizontal motion of the second ball is independent of its vertical motion, meaning that its path would appear the same as the first ball's if you rotated this image 90 degrees. This is an example of the concept of superposition - the second ball is almost like the ball tossed in the air by the person on the train in the example in the prelecture. So, its vertical motion would be unaffected by its horizontal motion.",1,Student 58
"We know that both balls have an initial vertical velocity of 0 m/s and a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2. Vertical velocity determines the time the balls spend in the air. When comparing this to the equation ""vertical distance = (viy)t + 0.5at^2"", since both the initial vertical velocity, vertical distance, and gravity values are equal, the time at which the balls hit the ground will also be equal.",1,Student 48
"Dropped from the same height, both balls would have identical y-direction velocity and identical time in the air. Due to gravity constantly accelerating in a negative direction, both balls under these conditions would hit the floor at the same time",1,Student 52
Both balls have up/down and left/right motions. The ball on the right being dropped straight down has no left/right motion but the ball on the left does. This only means that the ball on the right travels further away from the tower but still the same distance down with the same pull from gravity in the down direction,1,Student 43
"Both balls are dropped with 0 additional vertical velocity. The only variable that affects the time it takes for the ball to reach the ground is the acceleration due to gravity, which is a constant. Without any additional velocity, the balls would reach the ground at the same time.",1,Student 50
"I'm not quite sure what was meant by ""dropped horizontally"", but the diagram depicts a ball being launched in the horizontal direction, so I dropped and threw a rock to confirm my logical assumption that the horizontal component of the ball's motion wouldn't affect how gravity acts on it. It seemed to me at first glance that a thrown ball would stay in the air longer, but after thinking further and testing it out it makes sense that they would hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 60
They would land on the ground at the same time because the speed at which they fall is not affected by their distance in the x axis,1,Student 49
I say that both balls will hit the ground at the same time because the only force the balls feel on the y-axis is gravity. Gravity will make both hit the ground at the same time from the same height.,1,Student 46
"The balls will hit the ground at the same time because, even though their horizontal launches are different, they have the same vertical force acting upon them, gravity, causing the balls to reach the ground at the same time.",1,Student 5
"It's weird to think about in a literal sense but if you split the motions up into x and y directions it becomes clear they are moving the same amount downwards, so the distance travelled horizontally won't impact the time they hit the ground.",1,Student 53
"The constant velocity of the ball going upwards will be equal to the constant acceleration of the ball falling off horizontally. Because they are both falling from the same height, the angle and direction in which they are falling does not matter",1,Student 57
"Both balls travel vertically to the ground. The second ball happens to have an additional horizontal component to it. Though the distance it travels is farther, gravity is constant and influencing both equally.",1,Student 55
"The girl is simply standing on the conveyor belt, she is not moving. Therefore, her speed is 0m/s, and the speed of the dog relative to the girl is the same as the speed of the dog relative to the belt.",2,Student 47
"Since the girl is not moving relative to the belt, the dogs motion relative to the girl is the same as its motion relative to the belt, which has a speed of 8 m/s.",2,Student 51
"The girl and dog are both on the same surface/reference frame: the conveyor belt. Since they're moving at the same speed before accounting for the dog's speed, the dog's speed is the only factor here in closing the distance between the two. That is, until the conveyor runs out of space and deposits the dog and/or girl at the end.",2,Student 58
"Again, the way I processed this question was by first identifying that this is happening at a 1D level. Therefore, we can employ the idea of V vector a,c = V vector a,b + V vector b,c; in this case, it was V vector dog,girl = V vector girl,belt + V vector dog,belt, where V vector dog,girl = 0 m/s - 8 m/s. This lead to -8 m/s being the velocity of the dog in relation to the ground (or 8 m/s in the negative direction). The girl's velocity in relation to the belt is 0 m/s because she is simply standing on it.",2,Student 48
The dog would reach the girl faster than if the girl was at rest so the speed of the dog must be faster to her than 8m/s,2,Student 43
"I think the answer may still be six because since the girl is standing on the belt her speed would equate to the speed of the belt which is 2 m/s while the dog is still moving -8 m/s. With respect to the girl, the speed is still 6 m/s since its the abs. value of -8 plus 2.",2,Student 52
The girl is moving to the dog at 2m/s and the dog is moving to the girl at 8m/s so you combine the two forces to get 10m/s,2,Student 49
You would add the 8 m/s and 2/s because they are both coming together towards each other. This would result in a velocity of 10 m/s.,2,Student 53
"Using velocity relations for relative motion again, we can see that the dog is going 8 m/s relative to the belt (v(a,c)). The girl is going 0 m/s relative to the belt because she is just standing, not moving (v(c,b)). So, if we add 8 m/s and 0 m/s, we get 8 m/s. We are not concerned with the ground in this answer, just the belt.",2,Student 46
"Because both the dog and the girl are on the conveyor belt, the belt is relatively the stationary for them both. Therefore, the speed of the speed of the dog for the girl would be the same as the diagram shows.",2,Student 6
"The speed of the dog relative to the girl will be 6m/s because I honestly see it as the two eventually colliding, meaning that within the same second that the dog travels 8m the woman also travels 2m. The remaining distance between the two will be 6m and the difference will decrease like this until the collision occurs. This is just my theory, which may be completely wrong.",2,Student 45
The girl is not moving so her velocity is 0 m/s. The dog then is moving 8m/s toward the girl regardless of the velocity of the belt.,2,Student 50
I'm having a hard time deciding between 6 and 8m/s but thinking about the elevator problem we did from inside the elevator the ball was moving the same as it would be if there was no elevator so i assume for this problem the same logic applies that since the lady is on the belt then the dogs speed should remain similar to how it would be if the belt wasnt there. the reason im still caught on 6m/s a little bit is because just like in the first part the dog is still running against the belt just like how earlier the girl was swimming against the current,2,Student 59
"The dog is moving 8 m/s to the left on the conveyer belt, and the girl is standing still on the conveyer belt, so the 2 m/s to the right that both the dog and the girl are going does not matter with respect to the girl, and the dog's speed is just 8 m/s.",2,Student 5
"The girl's velocity is 0 m/s. So when we subtract 8 m/s by 0 m/s, we get 8 m/s. This makes sense because both the dog and the girl are unfazed by the velocity of the belt so the only relative speed they witness is that of each other's",2,Student 57
"The dog and the girl are both on the belt, so its movement in relation to the ground can be ignored. She is standing still on the belt while the dog is moving left at 8 m/s, so the dog would appear to be moving its speed relative to the belt: 8 m/s.",2,Student 60
"According to Newton's 2nd law, force and acceleration is proportional and have the same direction. Although, velocity does not. Change in velocity has the same direction of force and acceleration, but this is asking about the velocity when the box is in motion, which is not necessarily directly related to the direction of force and acceleration.",3,Student 47
"According to Newton's second law, the direction of the net force is the same as the direction of the object's acceleration. This means that the box has to have an acceleration that is parallel to the x axis. However, this does not necessarily mean that its velocity is also parallel to the x axis, as an object can have a velocity that is in a different direction than its acceleration.",3,Student 51
"The box could have a negative initial velocity. In that case, the net force, according to Newton's second law, would push the box in the positive x direction, giving a positive acceleration, but the acceleration might not catch up to the velocity right away.",3,Student 58
"Acceleration is parallel to the x axis because acceleration is directly proportional to the Fnet, so it would make sense that they are parallel (F = ma). Acceleration is dv/dt, which would place velocity in a way I honestly don't know how to deduce. I'm almost trying to think of a car crash coming from the West side. I think the acceleration would be towards the center, but the velocity of the car would go North east opposite to that... but I'm not quite sure.",3,Student 48
"The force exerted on the box is directly proportional to the acceleration. Since velocity is in regards to acceleration multiplied by the time, the box's velocity between the initial time and the final time will be some constant that demonstrates a linear line or a line with a slope greater than 0, making it not parallel to the x axis",3,Student 52
"Force is responsible for the change in the velocity of the mass, in this case the box, and change in velocity is just acceletation",3,Student 43
"We only know about the net force on the box, not its original momentum/motion; there's no way to know that its current velocity is only in the x direction. Therefore, the answer has to be B, due to the net force in the positive x direction and the lack of other information.",3,Student 60
The acceleration is parallel to the x axis because F=ma so the direction of the force is the same as the acceleration and therefore the acceleration is parallel to the x axis.,3,Student 6
"Force and acceleration are directly related. Net force is the mass times the acceleration. If net force results in a positive x direction, the acceleration is also in that direction.",3,Student 50
"If the force is acting on it in the positive x direction, then the box must be moving in the positive x direction and will therefore have a parallel acceleration to the x axis since it is not speeding up. The velocity would also be parallel because its direction is positive. I disagree with myself as I type this but I'm not sure what my opposing argument is.",3,Student 53
"This is true because acceleration is the change in velocity over a certain period of time, and the change in velocity (not the velocity) moves in the same direction as the net force according to Newton's second law of motion.",3,Student 45
The acceleration would be parallel to the x-axis because the net force is staying the same. The velocity would keep accelerating therefore it would not be parallel.,3,Student 49
"I say the answer is b because we know force and acceleration have the same direction according to Newton's Second Law, so if the net force of the box is going in the positive x-direction, so will acceleration. I did not choose c because there is no info given about velocity, so I can not determine if it is also parallel to the x-axis.",3,Student 46
"Since F = ma, force in the x-direction would mean that the acceleration would have to be moving directly in the x-direction as well, or else the force wouldn't be in the positive x-direction. However, having a positive x-direction net force does not necessarily mean that the velocity is also parallel to the x-axis, since the box could have moved in the negative x-direction at some point.",3,Student 5
"since the force of the box is moving in the positive x-direction, the motion of the box will be in the same direction as the force. Like using a leaf blower on leaves. The force of the leaf blower blows away from the person and when that force acts on the leaves the leaves also blow away from the person",3,Student 59
