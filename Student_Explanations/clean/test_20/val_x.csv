"Acceleration is the slope of velocity. Since the velocity is decreasing, that means acceleration is negative, and when velocity is increasing, acceleration is positive.",0,Student 104
"Acceleration is the time rate of change of velocity, so it is represented by the slope of the velocity-time graph. The velocity-time graph has a negative slope until t = 0, after which it has a positive slope. The value of the correct acceleration-time graph, then, should be negative until t = 0 and positive after this point. This is true of the graph I selected.",0,Student 16
"According to velocity and time graph, velocity decreases over time interval (-infinity; 0). This means that acceleration is negative om that interval. That is why I chose ""A"".",0,Student 103
"Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity curve. Therefore, the acceleration curve should have a straight linear line because the velocity curve is a normal parabola or quadratic curve.",0,Student 14
"Because the acceleration is the slope of the v-t diagram, and the acceleration of the v-t diagram changes from negative to zero and then to positive. Thus, A plot represents perfectly the relationship between acceleration and time which fits the displacement and velocity curves shown above.",0,Student 100
I looked strictly at the velocity graph above to find the pattern with the slope. I found that the slope was negative until the origin and positive after the origin. This means that the values of the acceleration graph need to be negative until the origin and positive after the origin. This corresponded to the first graph.,0,Student 1
"I chose A because at first velocity is decreasing, which means acceleration is negative however speeding up. Then velocity is increasing and speeding up, showing positive acceleration. I tried to slowly see the relationship of velocity and acceleration at each line.",0,Student 2
The slope of the velocity graph is what the acceleration would be. And the slope of that line is negative until it reached zero and then the slope was positive again. So the acceleration would have to have negative values then hit zero and then be positive.,0,Student 12
"Before x=0, velocity is going down which means acceleration is negative. After x = 0, velocity is increasing which means acceleration is positive.",0,Student 15
"The slope of the velocity graph is at zero at t = 0. Before t=0, the slope is negative and after the t=0 the slope is positive.",0,Student 13
acceleration tells us how fast velocity is changing and so the acceleration curve will be the slope of the velocity curve,0,Student 17
"Since velocity is a parabola, x^2, then acceleration would be the derivative which is 2x. Also, acceleration would be constant and would be a straight line.",0,Student 11
"The displacement graph is showing that it starts out below, and then looking at the derivative, or instantaneous speed, is slowing down around zero, and then speeding up again. The first acceleration curve makes the most sense, because acceleration is starting negatively, and then getting less negative, then hitting zero, and then becoming more positive, aka speeding up.",0,Student 19
"Since the questions asks which ball hits the ground first, that is talking about the vertical motion. They are both launched or dropped at the same time from the same height and experience the same gravity so it will take the same amount of time for the balls to hit the ground.",1,Student 104
The concept of superposition comes into this question because both x and y components act independently of each other. So both of the balls are going to hit the ground at the same time regardless of the velocities acting on the balls.,1,Student 14
"Vertical acceleration is the same for both, and initial vertical velocity is 0 hence they should be in the same verticality thus they hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 15
"Because if ball is launched horizontally it means that ball has only horizontal initial velocity and zero vertical velocity. Another ball is dropped vertically, meaning that it also has zero initial vertical velocity. So both balls has zero initial vertical velocity, has same acceleration due to gravity and are launched from same height. So both balls will gain 9.81 m/s velocty after 1 sec, 19.62m/s after 2 sec etc., and go through same distance in 1, 2, 3 seconds. Because distance is area under velocity vs time graph. That's why I both balls hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 103
"Both balls fall due to gravity, while one is rolled off the side, the other is dropped straight down. If both start falling at the same exact time, they should both hit the ground at the same exact time. This makes sense as the ball that is launched horizontally did not gain any upward momentum/force, thus the only vertical force acting on it is gravity. Thus if both are experiencing the same force of gravity, both will hit the ground.",1,Student 102
Both balls have equal y-axis velocities due to the constant acceleration of gravity which acts downwards. Because they have the same velocity along the y-axis they should reach the ground at the same time.,1,Student 17
"A ball launched at a perfect horizontal only has initial velocity in the x direction. Therefore, the initial y velocity of both balls is the same and changes the same amount due to gravity until they hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 1
"Both balls hit the ground at the same time because they both have the same initial velocity, 0, and acceleration, 9.8m/s^2",1,Student 11
"I think that the both of the balls will hit the ground at the same time because their initial velocities, as well as their acceleration (g=10m/s^2) is the same.",1,Student 19
"As said in the prelecture, if they are at the same initial height, they will hit at the same time. I think it has to do x and y being independent variables.",1,Student 2
"vertical and horizontal components of velocity are independent of each other, and in these two instances, the vertical component is the same so both balls will land at the same time",1,Student 20
"Since the first ball is launched horizontally, the initial velocity on the vertical direction v0y is zero, and thus the equation of the displacement of the ball in the y direction can be simplified as y=-1/2gt^2. Also, since the two balls are setting at the same height at first and are dropping/launching at the same time, their displacement in the vertical direction is the same. Thus, according to the equation of the displacement of an object in the y direction, we can know that the time when two balls will spend to hit the ground only relates to the displacement in the y direction and the acceleration of gravity. Therefore, the two balls will hit the ground at the same time since they share the same displacement in the y direction (the height is the same) and the same acceleration of gravity.",1,Student 100
"Both balls share the same values for vertical velocity, initial height, and they experience constant acceleration, or gravity. Thus, both land on the ground at the same time given that the kinematic equation for the y component depend on vertical velocity, vertical acceleration, and the initial height.",1,Student 13
"Regardless of the first ball's horizontal component, if they are both dropped at the same time they will both hit the ground at the same time because acceleration due to gravity is the same for both balls and only acts in the vertical direction, and they both have an initial vertical velocity of zero. Horizontal motion is not relevant here because it can be treated separately from vertical motion, which determines the time the ball is in the air.",1,Student 16
"The girl is going 2 m/s because she is standing on the belt and not moving. The velocity of the dog compared in relation to the belt is 8 m/s. Therefore the answer is the same, 6 m/s.",2,Student 14
"Since the girl is not moving, the speed of the dog relative to the girl will remain the same.",2,Student 104
There is no need to subtract 2m/s as both the dog and the girl are both experiencing the speed of 2m/s to the right as they are standing on the same belt.,2,Student 15
This can just be thought of as the girl standing on the ground and the dog running at her at 8 m/s. The question does not concern the perspective of the ground at all.,2,Student 1
"If girl and dog are evaluated with respect to ground, girl is moving at 2 m/s to the right and dog is moving at 6 m/s to the left. Since dog is approaching girl and together they approach each other at 6+2 m/s, dog is moving at 8m/s relative to girl.",2,Student 103
"Since the dog and the girl are both on the treadmill, they both have the same reference relative to the treadmill. Thus, the girl and dog do not seem to be affected by the treadmill, thus going 8 m/s towards her.",2,Student 102
"Since the girl is also on the belt that is moving, the dog would be moving the same speed relative to the girl that it would be relative to the belt.",2,Student 12
"The speed of the girl relative to the belt is 0 m/s. The speed of the belt relative to the dog is 8 m/s. Thus, the speed of the girl relative to the dog is 8 m/s.",2,Student 16
"The dog's speed with respect to the girl would be 8 meters / second, because the speed of the girl relative to the belt is 0, so the only velocity happening is the speed of the dog, which is 8 m/s.",2,Student 19
"I feel like its the same as the first question, dog is going negative direction and girl postive so vgirl= -8+2= 6",2,Student 2
There would be no change in velocity of the dog on the conveyor belt along with the girl. They are both in the frame as well for this reason.,2,Student 11
"Since the girl is not moving on the belt, we can treat her as a point on the belt. Thus, the speed of the dog relative to the girl is the same as the speed of the dog relative to the belt.",2,Student 100
The dog is moving in the direction of the girl and the girl is moving the direction of the dog because the belt is moving the same way. So I added the dog's speed to the speed of the belt as that is what the girl will see when she sees the dog.,2,Student 13
"force causes acceleration and when a force acts on an object, it causes it to accelerate in the same direction that the force is applied.",3,Student 17
"Unless the box has force exerted on it in the Y direction, the acceleration will only be coming from the x-direction, thus only the acceleration will be in the x direction, parallel to the x axis. If there is a force on the box going in a y direction, the acceleration and velocity would not be parallel, but going in a direction connected by the x and y components. Thus unless there is force exerted in the y direction, the acceleration will be parallel to the x axis. If the net force means the box is only being exerted in a positive x direction, the velocity and acceleration will both be parallel to the x axis.",3,Student 102
"If there is a force on the box and force is the thing that causes change in velocity, then velocity and the change in velocity (acceleration) would be in the same direction as the force applied to the box.",3,Student 12
"By Newton's 2-law net force has same direction as acceleration, because external force makes object to accelerate. So acceleration is in the positive x direction. If box was in rest before being pushed by force, it means that velocity is also created by same acceleration. If we just imagine net force and acceleration in positive x direction, velocity will be in same direction.",3,Student 103
"When a force is exerted on an object, it accelerates in the direction of the force. Since the object is accelerating, it also has velocity in that same direction.",3,Student 1
The acceleration (and only the acceleration) must be parallel to the x axis in this situation because net force causes an acceleration in the same direction as that net force. This does not require the velocity vector to point in the same direction as the acceleration because the change in velocity and the velocity itself are separate things represented by separate vectors.,3,Student 16
Force is directly related to acceleration,3,Student 104
"The net force and the acceleration are both vectors, and according to Newton's Second Law, F=ma, which means that net force and the acceleration must move in the same direction. Thus, since the net force is in the positive x position, the acceleration is also in the positive x direction. However, the velocity doesn't relate to the net force and the acceleration (which is the change of the velocity), so it could point at any position while the net force is in the positive x direction.",3,Student 100
"I believe that the second choice is the answer because when a force is acted upon a mass, there is acceleration going in that same direction, f=ma",3,Student 2
"because net force is along the x axis, common sensically, it would make sense that the box would move in the positive x direction, which would be parallel to the x axis",3,Student 20
Force is what accelerates an object hence we cannot say anything about velocity.,3,Student 15
There is no information about the initial velocity or the final velocity so its impossible to determine anything about the velocity. The direction of the force determines the direction of acceleration as force is the cause of motion.,3,Student 13
