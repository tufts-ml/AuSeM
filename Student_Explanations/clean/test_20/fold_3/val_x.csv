Acceleration is equivalent to the slope of the velocity graph. The slope of the velocity graph starts out negative and gets progressively more level as it approaches t=0. After t=0 the slope becomes positive. The first acceleration graph mirrors this pattern; it starts negative and changes to positive at t=0.,0,Student 64
I chose the graph that portrays a linear function because in the first part when the velocity is decreasing the acceleration is going to be negative because the final velocity is smaller than the initial velocity (aka slowing down). The in the second part when the velocity is increasing the acceleration is going to be positive because the initial velocity is smaller than the final velocity (aka speeding up).,0,Student 76
"According to the velocity graph, the acceleration starts off in the negative, and slows down until it is 0, then increases afterwards, as can be seen with the increase in velocity on the right side of the y-axis.",0,Student 78
"The velocity graph does not have a constant slope, meaning the acceleration is not constant either. The slope is also negative then positive, which is best represented in the absolute value graph.",0,Student 7
"The displacement graph is the equation x^3, therefore the velocity equation is 3x^2. That means that the acceleration equation will be 6x, which is shown in answer option A. Also the tangent of the velocity line to the left of the y axis is negative, so therefore the acceleration must be negative which allowed me to choose option A over option.",0,Student 66
"When t<0, the velocity is clearly decreasing. Therefore, its derivative (acceleration) is negative when t<0.",0,Student 8
I chose the graph on the bottom because the velocity and time of the graphs shown above are curved and reached negative points in the graph. The graphs above all show the object was not constant during the increase and decrease of velocity.,0,Student 67
I say the first graph because the displacement of the object was always moving in the positive direction and not stopping or changing,0,Student 65
"Since the acceleration is the change in velocity over time or the derivative of velocity, the slope of the velocity vs. time graph would be the graph of the object's acceleration.",0,Student 69
"The acceleration is the derivative of the the velocity. By looking at the above graphs, we can see that the velocity is a quadratic function, like x^2. Since the derivative of a quadratic function is a linear function (and not an absolute value function), it can be determined that the graph of the acceleration is the first graph.",0,Student 75
"Although the graph showing the velocity is positive, the displacement graph shows that the object was in a negative position but then moved to a positive one. In terms of acceleration I thought this was represented by starting in the negative, crossing the origin, and moving into the positive.",0,Student 63
The acceleration would be a straight increasing line that crosses the origin because looking at the displacement graph it increases to zero from the negative direction getting slower shown by the acceleration graphs positive increase to zero with negative numbers and then it’s positive increase after it reaches zero. Similarly it can be seen in another way on the velocity graph where the slope is negative until it reaches the zero midpoint and then positive. The derivative of a parabola is a straight line.,0,Student 77
"Since acceleration is the derivative of a velocity function, and the velocity function is a parabola, the graph of acceleration will be straight line with a constant slope.",0,Student 68
"The velocity funciton is of the general form: f(x)=x^2. As learned in the prelecture videos, acceleration can be derived by integrating (haha) the velocity function.",0,Student 71
"The displacement represents the area under the curve, therefore the graph most accurate that would represent that derivative would be the linear slope.",0,Student 73
"just looking at the velocity graph, the velocity is decreasing (neg acceleration) and then increasing (positive acceleration)",0,Student 74
"What makes the ball fall is gravity and the gravitational acceleration is the same for both balls. The horizontal and vertical motion that the balls follow are independent of each other, so it doesn't matter that one might travel more horizontally than the other.",1,Student 76
"An objects motion can be broken into vertical and horizontal components. In both cases, gravity is the only thing affecting the ball's vertical motion so the balls will accelerate downward at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 64
Both balls are falling from the same height and since gravity is acting equally on both of the balls they reach the bottom at the same time,1,Student 77
"Since the force of gravity takes effect on both balls, they will therefore hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 78
"Once the ball leaves the stand, if one is dropped and one is launched off, both balls will still hit the ground at the same time. Both balls will hit the ground at the same time because the only forces acting upon the balls, Excluding air and wind resistance, is gravity. Gravity applies a constant pressure on the balls at 9.81m/s^2.",1,Student 65
Horizontal velocity has no effect on vertical position. The ball launched horizontally will experience the same gravitational force as the ball dropped vertically.,1,Student 8
"At first, I was confused because there was no initial velocity or angle given for the projectile. Then I realized this information was not needed because horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other, making the balls hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 7
"The reason both balls will hit the ground at the same time is because the motion of the ball that is launched is just the superposition of a ball moving in the x and y direction. By that I mean that there are two components of the ball's movement. One is the ball being dropped from the height it is at, and one is the ball being moved on the x axis to the right. The Y component (the ball being dropped with constant acceleration; gravity) of the launched ball is exactly the same as the ball that is being dropped. Therefore because both balls have the exact same components in the y direction they will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 66
I believe both of them will hit the ground at the same time because the idea of superposition. Super position states that the horizontal motion and vertical motion will be equal as long as they are dropped from the same position,1,Student 63
Both balls will hit the ground at the same point because even though one ball is launched they both start at the same height and must travel the same vertical distance. How far the launched ball moves left or right has no impact on how fast it moves up and down.,1,Student 68
"given what was learned about superposition, as long as the thrown ball is launched at a truly horizontal angle, without anything impacting their acceleration, they will hit the ground at the same time since the x and y equations are independent",1,Student 74
"Projectile motion is completely separate for each axis of motion: In other words, as long as the force applied in the relevant direction (downwards, in this case) is the same for both objects (which it is here: both objects have zero down force applied), then the force applied in other directions is completely irrelevant: it will have no effect on the outcome in the relevant direction.",1,Student 75
"Both will hit the ground at the same time! If thought of in vectors, the only vectors on either ball in the Y direction are due to gravity. As gravity starts affecting both balls at the same time and has the same magnitude (and direction) of acceleration, both balls will then move the same distance toward the ground in the same amount of time. And after enough time has passed, both balls will hit the ground simultaneously.",1,Student 71
"Since the dog's speed relative to the belt is 8m/s, and the girl is on the belt not moving, she will be moving toward the dog at a speed relative to the belt of 0m/s, meaning that only the dog's speed is influencing how fast it is approaching the girl. If the girl was moving closer and farther away from the dog, then the speed of the dog relative to the girl would change.",2,Student 78
"the girl is not moving while on the moving belt. as a result, the answer is the same as the velocity of the dog relative to the belt.",2,Student 74
"We know that the girl is moving 2m/s relative to the belt because she is just standing on the belt and it is given that the dog relative to the belt is moving -8m/s. Then we can set up the equation: Vdog,girl+Vgirl,belt=Vdog,belt and plug in the values we know, which will then get us that the dog relative to the girl is moving 10m/s.",2,Student 76
"I believe that the dogs movement relative to the girl is 8m/s because the girl is moving at 2 m/s towards the dog while the dog is running at 8 m/s towards the girl. However, from the previous problem, we know that the dog is moving at 6m/s with respect to the ground, this means that when the dog hits the conveyor belt, the dogs speed slows down to 6 m/s towards the girl. Since the girl is moving at 2 m/s towards the dog, we can add both of these vectors together, 2+6=8m/s",2,Student 65
"The girl is moving towards the dog at 2 m/s so as opposed to the dog moving 8m/s when the girl isn’t moving, her velocity must be added to the dogs but because the dogs velocity is negative as opposed to the girls you are subtracting a negative number",2,Student 77
"I am actually not too sure about this question. Logically I feel like the answer has to be 10 because when two objects are moving towards each other they appear to go faster when you are looking from the point of view of the objects. But, when you add the two vectors together you get the same answer as before, 6m/s. To me that just doesnt make any sense so I am going to stick with 10 as the answer that logically makes sense to me.",2,Student 66
"She is not moving with the belt, and the dog is moving 8 m/s compared to the belt.",2,Student 67
"Both the dog and the girl are on the conveyer belt, i.e. they can both be measured against the same reference frame. The girl is stationary to the conveyer belt, while the dog is moving 8 m/s towards the girl to the conveyer belt.",2,Student 8
"Since the girl is moving towards the girl, and the girl is also moving towards the dog, the dog appears to be approaching faster than it is actually moving. This understanding is applied to the speed of the dog by adding the speed the girl is moving towards the dog(2m/s) and the speed the dog is moving towards the girl(8m/s).",2,Student 68
"First, imagine that the conveyor is made of connected tiles 1 meter x 1 meter. If the girl was the tile she is standing on (for the sake of simplifying this) and was treated as the origin of a 2D line, the dog would be moving towards it at a rate of 8 tiles per second; the dog moved eight tiles from the one it had just been sitting on in 1 second. So, relatively, the dog is moving 8 meters (or 8 tiles) per second toward the girl. That's pretty fast!",2,Student 71
"Since the girl is not moving on the belt, her speed relative to the belt would be 0 m/s and because we are observing the dog's speed relative to her, the dog would be going 6 m/s since she isn't moving. Basically like a person on a train looks like they're going a normal speed inside the train but outside like are going really fast relative to the ground.",2,Student 69
"The girl and the dog are both on the belt. If both their velocities were 0, then they would be stationary relative to each other. Because the dog is moving relative to the belt, it is also moving relative to the girl and at the same rate since she is at rest relative to the belt.",2,Student 64
The speed is still 10 because since the girl is not moving she is moving the same speed as the conveyer belt so the result is still the same,2,Student 63
"Because she is standing still, although the conveyor belt is moving, the dog remains approaching at 8m/s, and therefore the dog moves 8m/s relative to the girl because there is no opposing movement to add or subtract.",2,Student 73
"At first, I thought the dog would be moving 10 m/s relative to the girl (adding 2 m/s to 8 m/s). Then I realized the girl is not moving relative to the belt, so, from her perspective, the dog is only moving 8 m/s.",2,Student 7
"Relative to the walkway, the girl is stationary: she is only moving where the walkway moves her. As for the dog, we know from the question that the dog is moving 8 m/s relative to the walkway. As a result, we know that the dog (moving at 8 m/s) and the girl (moving at 0 m/s), are closing at 8 m/s.",2,Student 75
"Force and acceleration are directly related, so the acceleration would be parallel to the x axis.",3,Student 76
"Since the net force on the box is in the positive x-direction, the box's acceleration would remain parallel to the x-axis. However, since the velocity is increasing due to the acceleration being constant, it will look like a linear graph, therefore not being parallel to the x-axis.",3,Student 78
"The acceleration vector of an object is in the same direction as the force vector applied to that object. This means that acceleration is parallel to the x-axis, in the positive x direction. However, we know nothing about the initial velocity of the box. The box could by traveling in some other axis, a y-direction for instance. Therefore, the velocity is not strictly parallel to the x-axis.",3,Student 8
"Using the information we have been given I think that we can only be sure that the acceleration is parallel to the x axis. I know that acceleration is parallel to the x axis because force and acceleration move in the same direction. I would say that it is likely that the velocity also goes the same direction, but there could be other factors that make this not the case.",3,Student 66
"Like it was said in the pre lecture videos, the magnitude of the acceleration of the object id directly proportional to the force or the net force enacted on that object",3,Student 65
Since you can set your Cartesian coordinates to where ever you want setting up the movement of the box in the positive x direction will ensure it moves along the x axis and since that is the way it’s velocity is moving the acceleration will also be moving in that direction until it is acted upon by a force that changes that parallel motion. That is not to say though that the motion is parallel. It may move in the positive x direction based on where the origin is but if you have a changing acceleration that will not be parallel nor will the velocity and situations like that cannot be determined without more info,3,Student 77
I chose c because while forcing of an object equals to the velocity that all moves in the same direction.,3,Student 67
"Force is what causes something to accelerate, and, like acceleration, is a vector. The direction of the net-force vector dictates that direction that the box will accelerate.",3,Student 64
"I'm not completely sure if I am right, but I think it would make sense if both the velocity and the acceleration are in the x-direction because that is the direction in which the force is being exerted.",3,Student 7
"Since Force and Acceleration depend on each other, the force exerted on the box should be roughly proportional. Also since the problem said the net force is in the positive direction then we can deduce that the acceleration is also in the positive x-direction since a = F/m",3,Student 69
"Newton's 2nd law says that an object accelerates in same direction as force. This means that the acceleration is parallel to the x axis, since the net force is in the positive x direction (only, meaning no movement in y directions). However, just because an object is accelerating in a specific direction does not mean that the velocity is always in that same direction; it just means that the velocity is changing in that direction. No Newton law says what the velocity will be, so this is the only answer.",3,Student 74
"Newton's second law states that Force = Mass x Acceleration. This applies to the direction as well as the magnitude. What we can conclude then, is that the direction of the net force will always be in the same direction of the acceleration. I want to describe my explanation further with a diagram but I cannot. Something I learned in the last class was velocity and acceleration can be in two different directions (like a car driving in a circle). The velocity of the box could be in some direction, but its acceleration could be in any direction; this is because acceleration is a measure in the chance in velocity, but not the 'net' velocity vector of an object.",3,Student 71
"We from Newton's second law that F = m*a. As a result, it can be concluded that force must be equal to the acceleration, which means that if force is in a specific direction, the acceleration must be in that direction. However, velocity does not have to be in the same direction as the force: picture a rocket ship moving through space sideways, that then suddenly turns on the engine. It's velocity will still be mostly in the sideways direction, but the force will be pointing a completely different direction.",3,Student 75
The acceleration has to be parallel to the x axis because since the force of the box is going in that positive x direction the acceleration is going the same way,3,Student 63
Let's say the positive x direction is the right. The box could be speeding up to the right in which case both its velocity and acceleration would be pointing to the positive x direction. The box could also be moving to the negative x direction before another force is exerted on in and since the net force is pos x direction the velocity is still moving to the pos x direction but since the box is slowing down the acc is in the negative x direction. Either way the velocity and acceleration are both parallel to the x axis.,3,Student 68
Since the net force is in the positive x-direction the box will be moving parallel to the x-axis however acceleration can still be negative so there is no guarantee acceleration will be parallel to the x-axis,3,Student 73
