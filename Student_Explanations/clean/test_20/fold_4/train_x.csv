0,1,2
It shows the slope of the given velocity,0,Student 47
"Since acceleration is the derivative of velocity, one must look how the slope of the velocity graph changes over time to determine the acceleration graph. The slope of the velocity graph is negative until it reaches zero, and then the slope is positive. The slope also decreases until it reaches zero, and then it increases again. These characteristics are shown in the acceleration graph I chose. It is negative until it reaches zero. The graph also changes from being far from zero, to close to zero, to far again.",0,Student 61
"Acceleration is equal to the rate of change in velocity. On the left side of the graph, the velocity is decreasing, so the acceleration is negative. On the right side of the graph, the velocity is increasing, so the acceleration is positive.",0,Student 51
"The function for acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function. This means that the acceleration graph comprises of many different instantaneous slopes on the velocity graph. Since velocity is decreasing when t<0, this means that the slope is negative, and the graph for acceleration will have to go below the x-axis when t<0.",0,Student 28
"Acceleration is the slope of velocity. Since the velocity is decreasing, that means acceleration is negative, and when velocity is increasing, acceleration is positive.",0,Student 104
Acceleration is equivalent to the slope of the velocity graph. The slope of the velocity graph starts out negative and gets progressively more level as it approaches t=0. After t=0 the slope becomes positive. The first acceleration graph mirrors this pattern; it starts negative and changes to positive at t=0.,0,Student 64
I chose the graph that portrays a linear function because in the first part when the velocity is decreasing the acceleration is going to be negative because the final velocity is smaller than the initial velocity (aka slowing down). The in the second part when the velocity is increasing the acceleration is going to be positive because the initial velocity is smaller than the final velocity (aka speeding up).,0,Student 76
"The acceleration curve can be derived from the velocity curve. Since the velocity curve starts negative and gradually becomes more positive, the first graph represents its acceleration.",0,Student 29
"Because the slope of velocity is decreasing when t<0, then the slope = 0 at t=0 and then the slope is increasing when t >0, the acceleration must show this as well because the slope of the velocity = acceleration. The second graph has a slope of 0 at t=0 so it must be this one.",0,Student 27
"I chose answer A because in the graph of velocity versus time, the slope of the line to the left of the y-axis is decreasing, and the slope of the line to the right of the y-axis is increasing. This means that in the graph of acceleration versus time that the line would have to be below the x-axis for values left of the y-axis and above the x-axis for values to the right of the y-axis. This correlates to graph A and not graph B.",0,Student 34
"The velocity graph shows a negative derivative until 0 then is positive after that, and only the second picture shows that",0,Student 43
"I chose A because the slope of the velocity graph, which is the acceleration, is negative but becomes less and less negative as it approaches zero. After zero, the acceleration becomes positive. This aligns with A because the graph shows that at some point the acceleration is below zero.",0,Student 62
"According to the velocity graph, the acceleration starts off in the negative, and slows down until it is 0, then increases afterwards, as can be seen with the increase in velocity on the right side of the y-axis.",0,Student 78
"I chose the first acceleration graph because if you take the instantaneous velocity from the curve, or basically look at the slope of the velocity curve, when x is less than 0, the slope is negative. This means that the points on the acceleration curve must be negative when x is less than 0. That is only true for the first acceleration graph.",0,Student 35
"The velocity graph does not have a constant slope, meaning the acceleration is not constant either. The slope is also negative then positive, which is best represented in the absolute value graph.",0,Student 7
"The displacement graph is the equation x^3, therefore the velocity equation is 3x^2. That means that the acceleration equation will be 6x, which is shown in answer option A. Also the tangent of the velocity line to the left of the y axis is negative, so therefore the acceleration must be negative which allowed me to choose option A over option.",0,Student 66
"Acceleration is the time rate of change of velocity, so it is represented by the slope of the velocity-time graph. The velocity-time graph has a negative slope until t = 0, after which it has a positive slope. The value of the correct acceleration-time graph, then, should be negative until t = 0 and positive after this point. This is true of the graph I selected.",0,Student 16
"According to velocity and time graph, velocity decreases over time interval (-infinity; 0). This means that acceleration is negative om that interval. That is why I chose ""A"".",0,Student 103
"acceleration is the derivative of velocity. Since the velocity graph is a parabola, the acceleration graph has to be linear because the derivative of a parabola is a straight line.",0,Student 59
"According to the definition, acceleration is the time rate of change of velocity, therefore acceleration is equal to the derivative of velocity, which means the acceleration at a certain time t is the slope of the v-t graph at that time. The graph of acceleration can be drawn by plotting the slope of the v-t graph at each time point. As in the v-t graph above, the velocity is decreasing with a declining rate, and until it's reached zero, it starts to increase with a growing rate. As a result, the acceleration should generally increase from negative to positive.",0,Student 23
"Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity curve. Therefore, the acceleration curve should have a straight linear line because the velocity curve is a normal parabola or quadratic curve.",0,Student 14
"When t<0, the velocity is clearly decreasing. Therefore, its derivative (acceleration) is negative when t<0.",0,Student 8
"Because the acceleration is the slope of the v-t diagram, and the acceleration of the v-t diagram changes from negative to zero and then to positive. Thus, A plot represents perfectly the relationship between acceleration and time which fits the displacement and velocity curves shown above.",0,Student 100
"Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, so a graph showing the acceleration curve would resemble a graph of the derivative of the velocity graph. In this case, the velocity graph is a parabola, so its derivative would be a linear function, not one of absolute value (the other option).",0,Student 58
I chose the graph on the bottom because the velocity and time of the graphs shown above are curved and reached negative points in the graph. The graphs above all show the object was not constant during the increase and decrease of velocity.,0,Student 67
I say the first graph because the displacement of the object was always moving in the positive direction and not stopping or changing,0,Student 65
I looked strictly at the velocity graph above to find the pattern with the slope. I found that the slope was negative until the origin and positive after the origin. This means that the values of the acceleration graph need to be negative until the origin and positive after the origin. This corresponded to the first graph.,0,Student 1
"I chose A because at first velocity is decreasing, which means acceleration is negative however speeding up. Then velocity is increasing and speeding up, showing positive acceleration. I tried to slowly see the relationship of velocity and acceleration at each line.",0,Student 2
"Since the acceleration is the change in velocity over time or the derivative of velocity, the slope of the velocity vs. time graph would be the graph of the object's acceleration.",0,Student 69
"As acceleration is equal to the derivative of velocity, and the slope of the velocity graph is negative for t<0, then the acceleration vs time graph must have a section that is below the time axis, indicating a negative acceleration.",0,Student 37
"Acceleration is the slope of the velocity graph. Thus, the acceleration curve should begin as negative given that the velocity graph has a negative slope until it hits the origin, and after that the acceleration becomes positive as velocity curves back upwards. Option A is the only graph where the acceleration is negative in the beginning, so I chose it as the correct answer.",0,Student 38
The slope of the velocity graph is what the acceleration would be. And the slope of that line is negative until it reached zero and then the slope was positive again. So the acceleration would have to have negative values then hit zero and then be positive.,0,Student 12
"The acceleration is the derivative of the the velocity. By looking at the above graphs, we can see that the velocity is a quadratic function, like x^2. Since the derivative of a quadratic function is a linear function (and not an absolute value function), it can be determined that the graph of the acceleration is the first graph.",0,Student 75
"Acceleration is the derivative of velocity. The velocity is slowing down when x is less than 0, which indicates a negative acceleration. The velocity is then 0 at the point (0,0) and starts to increase, meaning that there is a positive acceleration. The graph that I chose displays a negative velocity before (0,0) and then a positive velocity after.",0,Student 40
"As seen in the velocity v. time graph, the slope of the quadratic curve is negative in approaching the origin (0,0) and positive following the origin. As such, because the acceleration is the slope, or derivative, of the velocity and the second derivative of the position, the acceleration is negative approaching the origin and positive following the origin.",0,Student 3
"Before x=0, velocity is going down which means acceleration is negative. After x = 0, velocity is increasing which means acceleration is positive.",0,Student 15
"Since acceleration is the derivative of velocity, then the graph would have to be a positive linear model. Option two does not work because there are negative slopes in the velocity graph, and these are shown on the option I chose.",0,Student 46
"I chose A because acceleration defines how velocity changes with time which is basically how the slope of the velocity curve is changing with time, hence the notation d v(t)/dt. The diagram in A shows the correct transition of the slope of the velocity curve from being negative to positive.",0,Student 45
"Although the graph showing the velocity is positive, the displacement graph shows that the object was in a negative position but then moved to a positive one. In terms of acceleration I thought this was represented by starting in the negative, crossing the origin, and moving into the positive.",0,Student 63
"If acceleration is equal to the derivative of the velocity (slope of the v vs. t graph) option a would be correct. If you take the derivative at certain increments from the negatives to 0 on the v vs. t graph you see the derivative goes from being more negative until it reaches 0. then, if you take the derivative from 0 to the positives you can see the derivative goes from 0 to increasingly positive. This data matches with graph A showing a line that goes from more negative to 0 to more positive.",0,Student 36
The acceleration would be a straight increasing line that crosses the origin because looking at the displacement graph it increases to zero from the negative direction getting slower shown by the acceleration graphs positive increase to zero with negative numbers and then it’s positive increase after it reaches zero. Similarly it can be seen in another way on the velocity graph where the slope is negative until it reaches the zero midpoint and then positive. The derivative of a parabola is a straight line.,0,Student 77
"As the graph of velocity as a function of time approaches zero, the velocity decreases but then increases again after t = 0. As a result of this, the velocity has a negative slope up until t=0 and then has a positive slope after t = 0. Therefore, the acceleration of this function would be negative until 0 and positive after 0, increasing at a steady rate. The first plot accurately represents this as it shows how the acceleration is steadily increasing from negative to positive.",0,Student 96
"On the left side of the velocity graph the object is slowing down but never goes backwards. The top graph shows the object having negative and positive acceleration, while the bottom graph only show positive acceleration.",0,Student 32
"The slope of the velocity graph is at zero at t = 0. Before t=0, the slope is negative and after the t=0 the slope is positive.",0,Student 13
"Since acceleration is the derivative of a velocity function, and the velocity function is a parabola, the graph of acceleration will be straight line with a constant slope.",0,Student 68
"Since the acceleration is the slope of the velocity vs time graph, we can see that the slope of the velocity vs time graph is negative as the function is decreasing towards zero. This trend is reflected in acceleration graph that I selected. Likewise when the function in the velocity-time graph is increasing, a positive acceleration is observed in the acceleration graph as the slope is positive.",0,Student 30
"As we can see in the velocity graph, v = 0 as it approaches 0 from the left. Here the acceleration is negative and has a negative slope, as shown in plot A. The velocity then increases, indicating the object is speeding up and having a positive acceleration.",0,Student 50
"The velocity funciton is of the general form: f(x)=x^2. As learned in the prelecture videos, acceleration can be derived by integrating (haha) the velocity function.",0,Student 71
"The displacement represents the area under the curve, therefore the graph most accurate that would represent that derivative would be the linear slope.",0,Student 73
acceleration tells us how fast velocity is changing and so the acceleration curve will be the slope of the velocity curve,0,Student 17
"I chose this because acceleration is derived by taking the derivative of velocity. By taking the derivative of a quadratic velocity function, the resulting acceleration function will be linear.",0,Student 25
"Since velocity is a parabola, x^2, then acceleration would be the derivative which is 2x. Also, acceleration would be constant and would be a straight line.",0,Student 11
"Velocity is increasing at a parabolic rate, so acceleration must be linear",0,Student 21
"just looking at the velocity graph, the velocity is decreasing (neg acceleration) and then increasing (positive acceleration)",0,Student 74
"The answer is a because the velocity graph is decreasing when x<0, so acceleration would be negative, and then increasing when x>0, so acceleration would be positive.",0,Student 5
"The displacement graph is showing that it starts out below, and then looking at the derivative, or instantaneous speed, is slowing down around zero, and then speeding up again. The first acceleration curve makes the most sense, because acceleration is starting negatively, and then getting less negative, then hitting zero, and then becoming more positive, aka speeding up.",0,Student 19
"They hit the ground at the same time because vertical motion behaves independently of horizontal motion, and they both have the same vertical acceleration, initial velocity, and initial and final displacement.",1,Student 29
The initial velocity is the same and the only force on the ball is gravity which is constant.,1,Student 47
"The horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent of each other. Since the two balls with the same initial velocity (which is zero) are launched at exactly the same time, and experience free-fall in the vertical direction with the acceleration of g=9.8m/s^2, they should hit the ground at the same time, no matter the initial speed given horizontally on the second ball.",1,Student 23
"The x and y components are completely independent of each other for both balls. Since both balls have the same initial height, and once they are in the air, the only force acting upon them is gravity, they will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 34
Both balls are in freefall and are only being influenced by gravity so they will both experience the same downward acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2,1,Student 59
"Since the balls are dropped and launched from the same height, they will both hit at the same time because the only acceleration acting on them is gravity. The horizontal velocities of the balls do not matter because the vertical and horizontal projectiles are independent",1,Student 27
"The balls will hit the ground at the same time because the ball that is being launched is being launched in the x direction. Therefore, the velocity in the y direction will be equal to that of the ball that is dropped off of the platform. No additional force is being applied to the y direction of the launched ball that will alter the rate at which it falls.",1,Student 3
"What makes the ball fall is gravity and the gravitational acceleration is the same for both balls. The horizontal and vertical motion that the balls follow are independent of each other, so it doesn't matter that one might travel more horizontally than the other.",1,Student 76
"Since gravity has the same effect on both balls, both balls have the same vertical acceleration. The first ball was launched horizontally, meaning both balls have an initial vertical velocity of 0 and will reach the ground at the same time.",1,Student 51
"An objects motion can be broken into vertical and horizontal components. In both cases, gravity is the only thing affecting the ball's vertical motion so the balls will accelerate downward at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 64
"Since both balls leave the platform at the same time and both begin with a velocity in the y-direction of 0, they will reach the ground at the same time; gravity is the only force acting on both objects in the y-direction, so both balls will have the same y-velocity at every point in their respective trajectories.",1,Student 31
"Since the questions asks which ball hits the ground first, that is talking about the vertical motion. They are both launched or dropped at the same time from the same height and experience the same gravity so it will take the same amount of time for the balls to hit the ground.",1,Student 104
"How quickly the ball drops to the floor depends on the acceleration, initial height, and initial velocity of the balls in the y-direction. Both balls have an initial velocity of 0 unit/s: the dropped ball is let go from rest and the launched ball has no initial vertical velocity since its initial velocity is only put in the horizontal direction. Furthermore, the acceleration that both balls will have is the same since they are both only acted upon by gravity, which is the same everywhere. The picture also shows that the initial height of the ball is the same. Therefore, the balls will land at the same time.",1,Student 28
"The balls will hit the ground at the same time because they both start off with an initial velocity of zero. As the balls are launched off, gravity acts on the balls forcing them to go downwards. They have the same acceleration downwards and therefore will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 6
Both balls are falling from the same height and since gravity is acting equally on both of the balls they reach the bottom at the same time,1,Student 77
"Since the force of gravity takes effect on both balls, they will therefore hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 78
"I thought both hit at the same time because, as the video with the guy on the train showed, the vertical and horizontal components of an objects motion do not affect each other. So, I figured that as long as they are dropped from the same height at the same time, they will hit the ground at the same time too.",1,Student 62
"Once the ball leaves the stand, if one is dropped and one is launched off, both balls will still hit the ground at the same time. Both balls will hit the ground at the same time because the only forces acting upon the balls, Excluding air and wind resistance, is gravity. Gravity applies a constant pressure on the balls at 9.81m/s^2.",1,Student 65
"I said that both balls hit the ground at the same time because of the principal of superposition. Horizontal motion and vertical motion are completely independent of one another, so it doesn't matter that the second ball was thrown horizontally. We only want to think about the VERTICAL motion of the balls, which remains unchanged in both scenarios, and thus they'd hit the ground at the same time because the only force acting on them is acceleration due to gravity, at least in the y direction.",1,Student 38
"Because perpendicular vectors don't affect each other, as long as both initial velocities in the y direction are 0, acceleration due to gravity should affect both projectiles in the same manner and will cause them to fall to the ground at the same time.",1,Student 37
The concept of superposition comes into this question because both x and y components act independently of each other. So both of the balls are going to hit the ground at the same time regardless of the velocities acting on the balls.,1,Student 14
"The horizontal motion of the second ball is independent of its vertical motion, meaning that its path would appear the same as the first ball's if you rotated this image 90 degrees. This is an example of the concept of superposition - the second ball is almost like the ball tossed in the air by the person on the train in the example in the prelecture. So, its vertical motion would be unaffected by its horizontal motion.",1,Student 58
Horizontal velocity has no effect on vertical position. The ball launched horizontally will experience the same gravitational force as the ball dropped vertically.,1,Student 8
"At first, I was confused because there was no initial velocity or angle given for the projectile. Then I realized this information was not needed because horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other, making the balls hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 7
"Since the only force acting on both of the balls is the force of gravity, both have an acceleration of -9.8 m/s^2. When the balls are dropped from the same height and have the same acceleration, they will travel the vertical displacement in the same amount of time. Even though one of the balls has a horizontal displacement in addition to a vertical displacement, the fact that the ball is traveling horizontally too does not affect the time it will take for the ball to hit the ground, only the horizontal distance traveled.",1,Student 40
"The vertical motion of both balls are the same, and although they may have different starting velocities, their downward acceleration is the same (gravity) which means that their velocity will be 0 at the same time and this is when they will hit the ground.",1,Student 35
Both of the balls have the same vertical velocity ( because the thrown object is thrown with horizontal velocity and not vertical velocity). Because they have the same vertical velocity they will hit the ground at the same time. The thrown ball goes farther in the x direction because of the horizontal velocity.,1,Student 36
"The reason both balls will hit the ground at the same time is because the motion of the ball that is launched is just the superposition of a ball moving in the x and y direction. By that I mean that there are two components of the ball's movement. One is the ball being dropped from the height it is at, and one is the ball being moved on the x axis to the right. The Y component (the ball being dropped with constant acceleration; gravity) of the launched ball is exactly the same as the ball that is being dropped. Therefore because both balls have the exact same components in the y direction they will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 66
"Vertical acceleration is the same for both, and initial vertical velocity is 0 hence they should be in the same verticality thus they hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 15
"Dropped from the same height, both balls would have identical y-direction velocity and identical time in the air. Due to gravity constantly accelerating in a negative direction, both balls under these conditions would hit the floor at the same time",1,Student 52
Both balls have up/down and left/right motions. The ball on the right being dropped straight down has no left/right motion but the ball on the left does. This only means that the ball on the right travels further away from the tower but still the same distance down with the same pull from gravity in the down direction,1,Student 43
"Because if ball is launched horizontally it means that ball has only horizontal initial velocity and zero vertical velocity. Another ball is dropped vertically, meaning that it also has zero initial vertical velocity. So both balls has zero initial vertical velocity, has same acceleration due to gravity and are launched from same height. So both balls will gain 9.81 m/s velocty after 1 sec, 19.62m/s after 2 sec etc., and go through same distance in 1, 2, 3 seconds. Because distance is area under velocity vs time graph. That's why I both balls hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 103
"Both balls fall due to gravity, while one is rolled off the side, the other is dropped straight down. If both start falling at the same exact time, they should both hit the ground at the same exact time. This makes sense as the ball that is launched horizontally did not gain any upward momentum/force, thus the only vertical force acting on it is gravity. Thus if both are experiencing the same force of gravity, both will hit the ground.",1,Student 102
"Both balls are dropped with 0 additional vertical velocity. The only variable that affects the time it takes for the ball to reach the ground is the acceleration due to gravity, which is a constant. Without any additional velocity, the balls would reach the ground at the same time.",1,Student 50
I believe both of them will hit the ground at the same time because the idea of superposition. Super position states that the horizontal motion and vertical motion will be equal as long as they are dropped from the same position,1,Student 63
Both balls will hit the ground at the same point because even though one ball is launched they both start at the same height and must travel the same vertical distance. How far the launched ball moves left or right has no impact on how fast it moves up and down.,1,Student 68
Both balls have equal y-axis velocities due to the constant acceleration of gravity which acts downwards. Because they have the same velocity along the y-axis they should reach the ground at the same time.,1,Student 17
"The time the each ball takes to hit the ground is related to the height, acceleration, and vertical initial velocity. The heights and acceleration(g) of the two balls are the same. Initially, the first ball only has a horizontal velocity, and the other ball is freely falling, which means that the initial velocities of both balls are 0.",1,Student 99
"The balls would both hit the ground at the same time because they are both being acted on by the same vertical force. Even though the horizontally launched ball travels in the x direction, both balls are falling with an acceleration of 10 m/s^2 downwards meaning that they will hit the ground at the same time. This is because vertical and horizontal motion are unrelated in this instance.",1,Student 96
"given what was learned about superposition, as long as the thrown ball is launched at a truly horizontal angle, without anything impacting their acceleration, they will hit the ground at the same time since the x and y equations are independent",1,Student 74
"A ball launched at a perfect horizontal only has initial velocity in the x direction. Therefore, the initial y velocity of both balls is the same and changes the same amount due to gravity until they hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 1
"The vertical vector and horizontal vector have no effect on each other. Both balls start at the same height have the same downwards acceleration, so they will hit the ground at the same time",1,Student 32
"I'm not quite sure what was meant by ""dropped horizontally"", but the diagram depicts a ball being launched in the horizontal direction, so I dropped and threw a rock to confirm my logical assumption that the horizontal component of the ball's motion wouldn't affect how gravity acts on it. It seemed to me at first glance that a thrown ball would stay in the air longer, but after thinking further and testing it out it makes sense that they would hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 60
Both balls start with 0 downward force other than gravity. Horizontal and vertical forces are calculated independently of each other.,1,Student 97
"Projectile motion is completely separate for each axis of motion: In other words, as long as the force applied in the relevant direction (downwards, in this case) is the same for both objects (which it is here: both objects have zero down force applied), then the force applied in other directions is completely irrelevant: it will have no effect on the outcome in the relevant direction.",1,Student 75
"Both will hit the ground at the same time! If thought of in vectors, the only vectors on either ball in the Y direction are due to gravity. As gravity starts affecting both balls at the same time and has the same magnitude (and direction) of acceleration, both balls will then move the same distance toward the ground in the same amount of time. And after enough time has passed, both balls will hit the ground simultaneously.",1,Student 71
"The balls hit the ground at the same time because the only force acting on the balls when they are dropped or thrown is gravity. Gravity pulls the objects down at the same rate, regardless of the horizontal component of the ball. Thus the same force is acting on both balls and causing them to fall at the same rate, thus making them hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 98
I say that both balls will hit the ground at the same time because the only force the balls feel on the y-axis is gravity. Gravity will make both hit the ground at the same time from the same height.,1,Student 46
A ball dropped has less distance to travel than that of the one thrown horizontally.,1,Student 21
"The balls will hit the ground at the same time because, even though their horizontal launches are different, they have the same vertical force acting upon them, gravity, causing the balls to reach the ground at the same time.",1,Student 5
The two balls hit the ground at the same time because they are both accelerating due to gravity in the vertical direction. The horizontal motion of the balls are inconsequential to the change in the vertical height of the balls.,1,Student 30
"Both balls hit the ground at the same time because they both have the same initial velocity, 0, and acceleration, 9.8m/s^2",1,Student 11
"The constant velocity of the ball going upwards will be equal to the constant acceleration of the ball falling off horizontally. Because they are both falling from the same height, the angle and direction in which they are falling does not matter",1,Student 57
"I think that the both of the balls will hit the ground at the same time because their initial velocities, as well as their acceleration (g=10m/s^2) is the same.",1,Student 19
"As said in the prelecture, if they are at the same initial height, they will hit at the same time. I think it has to do x and y being independent variables.",1,Student 2
"Honestly I thought of the example of the bullet leaving the gun in the pre-lecture video. Even though one of the bullets was being shot out of a gun and the other it was being dropped straight down, they're being dropped at the same height. Because of vertical motion and horizontal motion are independent of each other, and the fact that the balls are being dropped from the same height, they will hit the floor at the same time.",1,Student 25
"vertical and horizontal components of velocity are independent of each other, and in these two instances, the vertical component is the same so both balls will land at the same time",1,Student 20
"Since the first ball is launched horizontally, the initial velocity on the vertical direction v0y is zero, and thus the equation of the displacement of the ball in the y direction can be simplified as y=-1/2gt^2. Also, since the two balls are setting at the same height at first and are dropping/launching at the same time, their displacement in the vertical direction is the same. Thus, according to the equation of the displacement of an object in the y direction, we can know that the time when two balls will spend to hit the ground only relates to the displacement in the y direction and the acceleration of gravity. Therefore, the two balls will hit the ground at the same time since they share the same displacement in the y direction (the height is the same) and the same acceleration of gravity.",1,Student 100
"Both balls travel vertically to the ground. The second ball happens to have an additional horizontal component to it. Though the distance it travels is farther, gravity is constant and influencing both equally.",1,Student 55
"When a ball is being launched horizontally, its velocity in the horizontal direction is constant and its acceleration in the horizontal direction is zero. As a result, any two balls dropping towards the ground from the same height would hit the ground at the same time, since the only the vertical velocity and acceleration changes.",1,Student 61
"Both balls share the same values for vertical velocity, initial height, and they experience constant acceleration, or gravity. Thus, both land on the ground at the same time given that the kinematic equation for the y component depend on vertical velocity, vertical acceleration, and the initial height.",1,Student 13
"Regardless of the first ball's horizontal component, if they are both dropped at the same time they will both hit the ground at the same time because acceleration due to gravity is the same for both balls and only acts in the vertical direction, and they both have an initial vertical velocity of zero. Horizontal motion is not relevant here because it can be treated separately from vertical motion, which determines the time the ball is in the air.",1,Student 16
"They both have the same constant acceleration (-10 m/s^2) in the y direction, an thus will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 22
"If the belt (and thus the girl) is moving 2m/s in the positive direction relative to the ground and the dog is moving 6m/s in the negative direction relative to the ground, the girl and the distance between the girl and the dog is decreasing at the are of the sum of the speeds of the girl and the dog. And thus, the dog is moving at a speed of 6m/s + 2m/s = 8m/s relative to the girl.",2,Student 31
"The girl is simply standing on the conveyor belt, she is not moving. Therefore, her speed is 0m/s, and the speed of the dog relative to the girl is the same as the speed of the dog relative to the belt.",2,Student 47
"The dog is moving at a speed of 8 relative to the girl, because it is moving at a speed of 8 relative to belt, which is moving at the same speed as the girl.",2,Student 29
"Since the girl is not moving relative to the belt, the dogs motion relative to the girl is the same as its motion relative to the belt, which has a speed of 8 m/s.",2,Student 51
"The girl is going 2 m/s because she is standing on the belt and not moving. The velocity of the dog compared in relation to the belt is 8 m/s. Therefore the answer is the same, 6 m/s.",2,Student 14
"Since the dog's speed relative to the belt is 8m/s, and the girl is on the belt not moving, she will be moving toward the dog at a speed relative to the belt of 0m/s, meaning that only the dog's speed is influencing how fast it is approaching the girl. If the girl was moving closer and farther away from the dog, then the speed of the dog relative to the girl would change.",2,Student 78
"Since the girl is moving toward the dog at 2m/s with the conveyor belt, and the dog is moving 8m/s toward the girl, the dog will be going 10m/s relative to the girl.",2,Student 34
"The girl and dog are both on the same surface/reference frame: the conveyor belt. Since they're moving at the same speed before accounting for the dog's speed, the dog's speed is the only factor here in closing the distance between the two. That is, until the conveyor runs out of space and deposits the dog and/or girl at the end.",2,Student 58
"I chose 8 m/s because the girl and the dog are both on the belt so the belt's speed does not really matter. As a result, the dog is moving 8 m/s relative to the girl.",2,Student 62
"Since the girl is not moving, the speed of the dog relative to the girl will remain the same.",2,Student 104
There is no need to subtract 2m/s as both the dog and the girl are both experiencing the speed of 2m/s to the right as they are standing on the same belt.,2,Student 15
"From the girl's perspective she is stationary, therefore the dog will be moving towards her at 8 m/s plus the speed at which the girl is moving so 10 m/s. Suppose the girl and the dog are 10 m apart, then it will take 1 second for the dog to cover 8 m and in that same time the girl would have covered 2 m so from the girl's perspective the dog covered that 10 m in 1 second. Thus, the dog's speed from the perspective of the girl is 10 m/s",2,Student 30
"the girl is not moving while on the moving belt. as a result, the answer is the same as the velocity of the dog relative to the belt.",2,Student 74
"The girl is standing at rest on the belt. The dog is moving at 8m/s on the belt. Since they are both on the same surface, we can assume that the belt acts as a ""ground"". Therefore, the dog moves 8m/s faster than the girl.",2,Student 28
"Because both the girl and the dog are moving 2 m/s on the belt, the dog's speed is 8 m/s relative to the girl, as there is no need to take into account the 2 m/s that the girl and the dog are moving at.",2,Student 37
"We know that the girl is moving 2m/s relative to the belt because she is just standing on the belt and it is given that the dog relative to the belt is moving -8m/s. Then we can set up the equation: Vdog,girl+Vgirl,belt=Vdog,belt and plug in the values we know, which will then get us that the dog relative to the girl is moving 10m/s.",2,Student 76
The woman and the dog are both moving closer and closer to one another. The woman is moving at a rate of 2 m/s while the dog runs towards her at a rate of 8 m/s. Therefore the two objects are getting closer to one another at a rate of 10 m/s.,2,Student 98
"Because the girl is standing still on the belt, she can be simply regarded as a point on the belt, which moves at 2m/s to the right. As the dog is moving at 8m/s to the left relative to the belt, it should be also moving at 8m/s to the right relative to the girl as they take the same reference frame, which is the belt.",2,Student 23
"I believe that the dogs movement relative to the girl is 8m/s because the girl is moving at 2 m/s towards the dog while the dog is running at 8 m/s towards the girl. However, from the previous problem, we know that the dog is moving at 6m/s with respect to the ground, this means that when the dog hits the conveyor belt, the dogs speed slows down to 6 m/s towards the girl. Since the girl is moving at 2 m/s towards the dog, we can add both of these vectors together, 2+6=8m/s",2,Student 65
You have to add the two velocities and the girl is moving 8 m/s and the dog is moving -2 m/s which means the speed of the dog relative to the ground in 6 m/s.,2,Student 35
"The girl moves at an equal rate as the belt. Therefore her speed relative to the belt is 0 m/s. The speed of the dog relative to the belt is 8 m/s. Taking the sum of the two speeds, one finds that the speed of the dog relative to the girl is 8 m/s.",2,Student 3
The dog would reach the girl faster than if the girl was at rest so the speed of the dog must be faster to her than 8m/s,2,Student 43
"The girl is moving towards the dog at 2 m/s so as opposed to the dog moving 8m/s when the girl isn’t moving, her velocity must be added to the dogs but because the dogs velocity is negative as opposed to the girls you are subtracting a negative number",2,Student 77
"Because the dog and the girl are on the same surface and the girl is standing still, the dog is running at 8 m/s towards the girl because even though the dog is getting ""pushed back"", the girl is getting pushed back at the same rate.",2,Student 27
"I am actually not too sure about this question. Logically I feel like the answer has to be 10 because when two objects are moving towards each other they appear to go faster when you are looking from the point of view of the objects. But, when you add the two vectors together you get the same answer as before, 6m/s. To me that just doesnt make any sense so I am going to stick with 10 as the answer that logically makes sense to me.",2,Student 66
This can just be thought of as the girl standing on the ground and the dog running at her at 8 m/s. The question does not concern the perspective of the ground at all.,2,Student 1
"I think the answer may still be six because since the girl is standing on the belt her speed would equate to the speed of the belt which is 2 m/s while the dog is still moving -8 m/s. With respect to the girl, the speed is still 6 m/s since its the abs. value of -8 plus 2.",2,Student 52
"If girl and dog are evaluated with respect to ground, girl is moving at 2 m/s to the right and dog is moving at 6 m/s to the left. Since dog is approaching girl and together they approach each other at 6+2 m/s, dog is moving at 8m/s relative to girl.",2,Student 103
"She is not moving with the belt, and the dog is moving 8 m/s compared to the belt.",2,Student 67
"The girl is standing on the belt, so the dog's speed relative to the girl will be the same os the dog's speed relative to the belt",2,Student 32
"Both the dog and the girl are on the conveyer belt, i.e. they can both be measured against the same reference frame. The girl is stationary to the conveyer belt, while the dog is moving 8 m/s towards the girl to the conveyer belt.",2,Student 8
"Since the girl is moving towards the girl, and the girl is also moving towards the dog, the dog appears to be approaching faster than it is actually moving. This understanding is applied to the speed of the dog by adding the speed the girl is moving towards the dog(2m/s) and the speed the dog is moving towards the girl(8m/s).",2,Student 68
"I chose 8 m/s because I applied the same formula here. To find the velocity of the dog relative to the girl, we have to add the velocity of the dog relative to the belt, and the velocity of the belt relative to the girl. We know the dog's velocity relative to the belt is -8m/s, and the girl is standing stationary on the belt, thus making the belt's velocity relative to the girl 0 m/s. If we add these, we still get 8 m/s.",2,Student 38
"Since the dog and the girl are both on the treadmill, they both have the same reference relative to the treadmill. Thus, the girl and dog do not seem to be affected by the treadmill, thus going 8 m/s towards her.",2,Student 102
"the girl and the dog are both affected by the conveyor belt, so its speed is not factored in. The dog is running at 8 m/s.",2,Student 97
"First, imagine that the conveyor is made of connected tiles 1 meter x 1 meter. If the girl was the tile she is standing on (for the sake of simplifying this) and was treated as the origin of a 2D line, the dog would be moving towards it at a rate of 8 tiles per second; the dog moved eight tiles from the one it had just been sitting on in 1 second. So, relatively, the dog is moving 8 meters (or 8 tiles) per second toward the girl. That's pretty fast!",2,Student 71
"The velocity of the dog relative to the girl is equal to the velocity of the dog relative to the belt plus the velocity of the belt relative to the girl. The velocity of the dog relative to the belt is 8 and the velocity of the belt relative to the girl is 0 (because the belt and the girl are moving at the same speed and direction. So, since 8+0=8, the speed of the dog relative to the girl is 8 m/s.",2,Student 40
"Since the girl is not moving on the belt, her speed relative to the belt would be 0 m/s and because we are observing the dog's speed relative to her, the dog would be going 6 m/s since she isn't moving. Basically like a person on a train looks like they're going a normal speed inside the train but outside like are going really fast relative to the ground.",2,Student 69
"the girl is moving at the same speed to of belt relative to the ground( in other words, the girl is standing still relative to the belt), so the speed of dog relative to the girl would equal to the speed of dog relative to the belt.",2,Student 99
"Since the girl is also on the belt that is moving, the dog would be moving the same speed relative to the girl that it would be relative to the belt.",2,Student 12
"The girl and the dog are both on the belt. If both their velocities were 0, then they would be stationary relative to each other. Because the dog is moving relative to the belt, it is also moving relative to the girl and at the same rate since she is at rest relative to the belt.",2,Student 64
"The speed of the girl relative to the belt is 0 m/s. The speed of the belt relative to the dog is 8 m/s. Thus, the speed of the girl relative to the dog is 8 m/s.",2,Student 16
The speed is still 10 because since the girl is not moving she is moving the same speed as the conveyer belt so the result is still the same,2,Student 63
"Because she is standing still, although the conveyor belt is moving, the dog remains approaching at 8m/s, and therefore the dog moves 8m/s relative to the girl because there is no opposing movement to add or subtract.",2,Student 73
"Using velocity relations for relative motion again, we can see that the dog is going 8 m/s relative to the belt (v(a,c)). The girl is going 0 m/s relative to the belt because she is just standing, not moving (v(c,b)). So, if we add 8 m/s and 0 m/s, we get 8 m/s. We are not concerned with the ground in this answer, just the belt.",2,Student 46
"Even though the view point changed, the movement of the belt will still effect the speed of the dog, so it will look like the dog has a velocity of 6 m/s.",2,Student 25
"The dog's speed with respect to the girl would be 8 meters / second, because the speed of the girl relative to the belt is 0, so the only velocity happening is the speed of the dog, which is 8 m/s.",2,Student 19
"Because both the dog and the girl are on the conveyor belt, the belt is relatively the stationary for them both. Therefore, the speed of the speed of the dog for the girl would be the same as the diagram shows.",2,Student 6
"The speed of the dog relative to the girl will be 6m/s because I honestly see it as the two eventually colliding, meaning that within the same second that the dog travels 8m the woman also travels 2m. The remaining distance between the two will be 6m and the difference will decrease like this until the collision occurs. This is just my theory, which may be completely wrong.",2,Student 45
"The relative velocity equation can also be used in this situation. The relative speed of the dog to the girl is equal to the sum of the velocity of the dog on the belt and the velocity of the belt on the girl. Since the girl is not moving on the belt, her velocity is 0, making the sum 8 + 0 = 8 m/s.",2,Student 22
"Since the dog and the girl are both on the reference frame of the conveyer belt, the speed at which the conveyer belt is moving is irrelevant in this situation. Therefore, the dog is still running toward the girl at a velocity of 8 m/s.",2,Student 96
The girl is not moving so her velocity is 0 m/s. The dog then is moving 8m/s toward the girl regardless of the velocity of the belt.,2,Student 50
Both the woman and the dog are on the conveyer belt,2,Student 21
"I feel like its the same as the first question, dog is going negative direction and girl postive so vgirl= -8+2= 6",2,Student 2
I'm having a hard time deciding between 6 and 8m/s but thinking about the elevator problem we did from inside the elevator the ball was moving the same as it would be if there was no elevator so i assume for this problem the same logic applies that since the lady is on the belt then the dogs speed should remain similar to how it would be if the belt wasnt there. the reason im still caught on 6m/s a little bit is because just like in the first part the dog is still running against the belt just like how earlier the girl was swimming against the current,2,Student 59
There would be no change in velocity of the dog on the conveyor belt along with the girl. They are both in the frame as well for this reason.,2,Student 11
"The dog is moving 8 m/s to the left on the conveyer belt, and the girl is standing still on the conveyer belt, so the 2 m/s to the right that both the dog and the girl are going does not matter with respect to the girl, and the dog's speed is just 8 m/s.",2,Student 5
"The girl's velocity is 0 m/s. So when we subtract 8 m/s by 0 m/s, we get 8 m/s. This makes sense because both the dog and the girl are unfazed by the velocity of the belt so the only relative speed they witness is that of each other's",2,Student 57
"The girl and the dog are getting closer. The girl is moving closer to the dog at 2 m/s and the dog is moving closer to the girl at 6 m/s. Therefore, from the perspective of the girl, the dog is moving 8 m/s. 6 m/s + 2 m/s = 8 m/s.",2,Student 61
"Since the girl is not moving on the belt, we can treat her as a point on the belt. Thus, the speed of the dog relative to the girl is the same as the speed of the dog relative to the belt.",2,Student 100
The dog is moving in the direction of the girl and the girl is moving the direction of the dog because the belt is moving the same way. So I added the dog's speed to the speed of the belt as that is what the girl will see when she sees the dog.,2,Student 13
"At first, I thought the dog would be moving 10 m/s relative to the girl (adding 2 m/s to 8 m/s). Then I realized the girl is not moving relative to the belt, so, from her perspective, the dog is only moving 8 m/s.",2,Student 7
"The dog and the girl are both on the belt, so its movement in relation to the ground can be ignored. She is standing still on the belt while the dog is moving left at 8 m/s, so the dog would appear to be moving its speed relative to the belt: 8 m/s.",2,Student 60
She's just watching the dog. So she sees how fast he is moving regardless of the effect of the walkway because they're both on it.,2,Student 36
"Relative to the walkway, the girl is stationary: she is only moving where the walkway moves her. As for the dog, we know from the question that the dog is moving 8 m/s relative to the walkway. As a result, we know that the dog (moving at 8 m/s) and the girl (moving at 0 m/s), are closing at 8 m/s.",2,Student 75
"We know nothing about the velocity of the box, so we cannot make any statements about the velocity's direction. However, we know through Newton's second law that the direction of the net force on an object is the same direction as the object's acceleration. The net force on the box is in the positive x direction, so we know that the acceleration of the box is parallel to the x-axis.",3,Student 34
"According to Newton's 2nd law, force and acceleration is proportional and have the same direction. Although, velocity does not. Change in velocity has the same direction of force and acceleration, but this is asking about the velocity when the box is in motion, which is not necessarily directly related to the direction of force and acceleration.",3,Student 47
"The net force (which is the force that determines an object's direction of acceleration) is moving in the positive x direction, meaning that the acceleration will also be in the positive x direction. However, the velocity does not necessarily have to be in the x direction. Depending on the time that you are measuring an object's velocity, it can move in any direction, although it will eventually go in the direction of the x-axis if. this force is continually exerted.",3,Student 28
"The box is accelerating in the x direction because force and acceleration are always in the same direction. However, the force could be in a different direction from the velocity if the box had already been moving in the negative x direction.",3,Student 29
"Force and acceleration are directly related, so the acceleration would be parallel to the x axis.",3,Student 76
"According to Newton's second law, the acceleration is provided by the net force acting on an object, which means the acceleration will have the same direction as the net force. Therefore, the acceleration is parallel to the x-axis. However, the velocity of the box could have any directions, because it could be a property that the box originally has, and it does not have to be parallel to the net force acting on the box.",3,Student 23
"Newton's second law states that F=ma so the force parallel to the x axis will equal the acceleration parallel to the x axis. Acceleration is the change in velocity. So even if the acceleration is parallel to the x axis, it does not guarantee that the change in velocity will be parallel to the x axis. Change in velocity does not equal velocity.",3,Student 27
"Since the net force on the box is in the positive x-direction, the box's acceleration would remain parallel to the x-axis. However, since the velocity is increasing due to the acceleration being constant, it will look like a linear graph, therefore not being parallel to the x-axis.",3,Student 78
"Neither the velocity nor the acceleration need to be parallel to the x axis because the net force could still be moving in the positive x direction but at an angle. As a result, if the force is moving at an angle, then its acceleration is as well, and the velocity could be.",3,Student 62
"I'm reading this as net force implying that there are multiple forces acting on this box. Clearly the force pushing in the positive x direction is larger than any of the other forces acting in different directions, which makes the net force point in the positive x direction. Still, these other forces need to be taken into account, so even though it would be moving in a generally positive direction, perhaps the acceleration is pointing slightly upwards rather than being perfectly parallel to the x axis because of a small force acting upwards on the box. That's why I chose the last option-- even though the acceleration is positive, it doesn't mean that it HAS to be parallel to the x axis.",3,Student 38
"According to Newton's second law, the direction of the net force is the same as the direction of the object's acceleration. This means that the box has to have an acceleration that is parallel to the x axis. However, this does not necessarily mean that its velocity is also parallel to the x axis, as an object can have a velocity that is in a different direction than its acceleration.",3,Student 51
"The acceleration vector of an object is in the same direction as the force vector applied to that object. This means that acceleration is parallel to the x-axis, in the positive x direction. However, we know nothing about the initial velocity of the box. The box could by traveling in some other axis, a y-direction for instance. Therefore, the velocity is not strictly parallel to the x-axis.",3,Student 8
"Just the acceleration is in the same direction of the net force. Because Newton's second law relates Acceleration and Force, the velocity of the box has nothing to do with the direction of the net force.",3,Student 37
"Using the information we have been given I think that we can only be sure that the acceleration is parallel to the x axis. I know that acceleration is parallel to the x axis because force and acceleration move in the same direction. I would say that it is likely that the velocity also goes the same direction, but there could be other factors that make this not the case.",3,Student 66
"Like it was said in the pre lecture videos, the magnitude of the acceleration of the object id directly proportional to the force or the net force enacted on that object",3,Student 65
"The box could have a negative initial velocity. In that case, the net force, according to Newton's second law, would push the box in the positive x direction, giving a positive acceleration, but the acceleration might not catch up to the velocity right away.",3,Student 58
Since you can set your Cartesian coordinates to where ever you want setting up the movement of the box in the positive x direction will ensure it moves along the x axis and since that is the way it’s velocity is moving the acceleration will also be moving in that direction until it is acted upon by a force that changes that parallel motion. That is not to say though that the motion is parallel. It may move in the positive x direction based on where the origin is but if you have a changing acceleration that will not be parallel nor will the velocity and situations like that cannot be determined without more info,3,Student 77
I chose c because while forcing of an object equals to the velocity that all moves in the same direction.,3,Student 67
"Since we do not know how many forces are acting on the object, we cannot assume that the velocity is parallel to the x-axis. However, the change in velocity, or acceleration, moves in the same direction as the net force because it represents the direction the object is moving. The acceleration vector must be moving in the same direction as the force.",3,Student 98
"The force exerted on the box is directly proportional to the acceleration. Since velocity is in regards to acceleration multiplied by the time, the box's velocity between the initial time and the final time will be some constant that demonstrates a linear line or a line with a slope greater than 0, making it not parallel to the x axis",3,Student 52
"force causes acceleration and when a force acts on an object, it causes it to accelerate in the same direction that the force is applied.",3,Student 17
"Force is responsible for the change in the velocity of the mass, in this case the box, and change in velocity is just acceletation",3,Student 43
"Only the acceleration needs to be parallel to the x-direction because Newton's 1st Law states that the acceleration points in the same direction that the force points. However, the velocity doesn't necessarily need to be going in the same direction as the acceleration. Both the velocity and acceleration would be parallel to the x-axis if the box is moving in the same direction as the acceleration and net force. However, it is also possible that the box's velocity is negative, and the net force and acceleration are positive. This scenario would probably be if you were stopping the box from moving towards you.",3,Student 40
"The forces that describe the box's motion are only the forces exerted on the box. If the total force on the box is in the x direction, there is no force in the y direction. This means any movement of the box is parallel to the x axis, including velocity and acceleration.",3,Student 61
"Since the box has a net force applied to it in the positive x-direction, the box will thus have an acceleration in the positive x-direction (parallel to the x-axis). Since the box has an acceleration in the positive x-direction, the box will thus have an (increasing) velocity in the positive x-direction (parallel to the x-axis).",3,Student 31
"The acceleration is parallel to the x axis as a force is being applied to the box in the x direction. If understand the concept correctly, force and acceleration work in the same direction. As such, acceleration would be parallel to the x axis. Velocity is not parallel to the x axis because a constant acceleration implies either an increase or decrease in velocity. As such, the velocity vector would appear at an angle to the x axis.",3,Student 3
"Unless the box has force exerted on it in the Y direction, the acceleration will only be coming from the x-direction, thus only the acceleration will be in the x direction, parallel to the x axis. If there is a force on the box going in a y direction, the acceleration and velocity would not be parallel, but going in a direction connected by the x and y components. Thus unless there is force exerted in the y direction, the acceleration will be parallel to the x axis. If the net force means the box is only being exerted in a positive x direction, the velocity and acceleration will both be parallel to the x axis.",3,Student 102
"We only know about the net force on the box, not its original momentum/motion; there's no way to know that its current velocity is only in the x direction. Therefore, the answer has to be B, due to the net force in the positive x direction and the lack of other information.",3,Student 60
"Force is what causes something to accelerate, and, like acceleration, is a vector. The direction of the net-force vector dictates that direction that the box will accelerate.",3,Student 64
"If there is a force on the box and force is the thing that causes change in velocity, then velocity and the change in velocity (acceleration) would be in the same direction as the force applied to the box.",3,Student 12
Because the box is being pulled in the horizontal direction the acceleration will also be in the horizontal direction which is parallel to the x axis.,3,Student 36
"Using Newton's Second Law, we can state that a = F/m. Since force is being used consistently in the positive x direction and the mass does not change, the acceleration is constant and thus parallel to the x-axis. The velocity thus has a positive slope, given acceleration is the derivative of velocity",3,Student 22
"By Newton's 2-law net force has same direction as acceleration, because external force makes object to accelerate. So acceleration is in the positive x direction. If box was in rest before being pushed by force, it means that velocity is also created by same acceleration. If we just imagine net force and acceleration in positive x direction, velocity will be in same direction.",3,Student 103
"I'm not completely sure if I am right, but I think it would make sense if both the velocity and the acceleration are in the x-direction because that is the direction in which the force is being exerted.",3,Student 7
"Since Force and Acceleration depend on each other, the force exerted on the box should be roughly proportional. Also since the problem said the net force is in the positive direction then we can deduce that the acceleration is also in the positive x-direction since a = F/m",3,Student 69
The acceleration is parallel to the x axis because F=ma so the direction of the force is the same as the acceleration and therefore the acceleration is parallel to the x axis.,3,Student 6
"According to newton's first law, the acceleration is directly proportional and in the same direction as the motion.",3,Student 35
"Force and acceleration are directly related. Net force is the mass times the acceleration. If net force results in a positive x direction, the acceleration is also in that direction.",3,Student 50
"When a force is exerted on an object, it accelerates in the direction of the force. Since the object is accelerating, it also has velocity in that same direction.",3,Student 1
"Newton's 2nd law says that an object accelerates in same direction as force. This means that the acceleration is parallel to the x axis, since the net force is in the positive x direction (only, meaning no movement in y directions). However, just because an object is accelerating in a specific direction does not mean that the velocity is always in that same direction; it just means that the velocity is changing in that direction. No Newton law says what the velocity will be, so this is the only answer.",3,Student 74
"Newton's second law states that Force = Mass x Acceleration. This applies to the direction as well as the magnitude. What we can conclude then, is that the direction of the net force will always be in the same direction of the acceleration. I want to describe my explanation further with a diagram but I cannot. Something I learned in the last class was velocity and acceleration can be in two different directions (like a car driving in a circle). The velocity of the box could be in some direction, but its acceleration could be in any direction; this is because acceleration is a measure in the chance in velocity, but not the 'net' velocity vector of an object.",3,Student 71
"This is true because acceleration is the change in velocity over a certain period of time, and the change in velocity (not the velocity) moves in the same direction as the net force according to Newton's second law of motion.",3,Student 45
"We from Newton's second law that F = m*a. As a result, it can be concluded that force must be equal to the acceleration, which means that if force is in a specific direction, the acceleration must be in that direction. However, velocity does not have to be in the same direction as the force: picture a rocket ship moving through space sideways, that then suddenly turns on the engine. It's velocity will still be mostly in the sideways direction, but the force will be pointing a completely different direction.",3,Student 75
"According to Newton's second Law, F(net) = ma, we could know that the direction of a is the the direction of F(net)",3,Student 99
"Force is how much an object's velocity can change, so as it accelerates in the positive direction, its net velocity should also go in that direction.",3,Student 21
The acceleration (and only the acceleration) must be parallel to the x axis in this situation because net force causes an acceleration in the same direction as that net force. This does not require the velocity vector to point in the same direction as the acceleration because the change in velocity and the velocity itself are separate things represented by separate vectors.,3,Student 16
Force is directly related to acceleration,3,Student 104
The force causes the velocity and the acceleration to point in the x direction,3,Student 32
The acceleration has to be parallel to the x axis because since the force of the box is going in that positive x direction the acceleration is going the same way,3,Student 63
"I say the answer is b because we know force and acceleration have the same direction according to Newton's Second Law, so if the net force of the box is going in the positive x-direction, so will acceleration. I did not choose c because there is no info given about velocity, so I can not determine if it is also parallel to the x-axis.",3,Student 46
"The net force and the acceleration are both vectors, and according to Newton's Second Law, F=ma, which means that net force and the acceleration must move in the same direction. Thus, since the net force is in the positive x position, the acceleration is also in the positive x direction. However, the velocity doesn't relate to the net force and the acceleration (which is the change of the velocity), so it could point at any position while the net force is in the positive x direction.",3,Student 100
"I believe that the second choice is the answer because when a force is acted upon a mass, there is acceleration going in that same direction, f=ma",3,Student 2
"Since force causes acceleration, then a net force acting on a box in the positive x-direction would cause the box to accelerate in this same direction because it is directly being subjected to the net force. I'm pretty sure the velocity would also be parallel to the x-axis but I was more confused about this part. My guess would be that since the net force is in the direction to the positive x-direction and the net acceleration is in the same direction, then the velocity would have to also be moving in that direction making it parallel to the x-axis.",3,Student 96
Let's say the positive x direction is the right. The box could be speeding up to the right in which case both its velocity and acceleration would be pointing to the positive x direction. The box could also be moving to the negative x direction before another force is exerted on in and since the net force is pos x direction the velocity is still moving to the pos x direction but since the box is slowing down the acc is in the negative x direction. Either way the velocity and acceleration are both parallel to the x axis.,3,Student 68
"The acceleration will be parallel to the x axis because Newton's second law states that net force and acceleration have to point in the same direction. As for the velocity, I think its direction will depend on whether the object was at rest at t=0",3,Student 25
"The direction of the net force is equal to the direction of motion and therefore the direction of velocity. Since force is equal to the product of an object's mass and acceleration, the net force in a particular direction will give rise to a net acceleration in the same direction.",3,Student 30
Since the net force is in the positive x-direction the box will be moving parallel to the x-axis however acceleration can still be negative so there is no guarantee acceleration will be parallel to the x-axis,3,Student 73
"because net force is along the x axis, common sensically, it would make sense that the box would move in the positive x direction, which would be parallel to the x axis",3,Student 20
"Since F = ma, force in the x-direction would mean that the acceleration would have to be moving directly in the x-direction as well, or else the force wouldn't be in the positive x-direction. However, having a positive x-direction net force does not necessarily mean that the velocity is also parallel to the x-axis, since the box could have moved in the negative x-direction at some point.",3,Student 5
Force is what accelerates an object hence we cannot say anything about velocity.,3,Student 15
"since the force of the box is moving in the positive x-direction, the motion of the box will be in the same direction as the force. Like using a leaf blower on leaves. The force of the leaf blower blows away from the person and when that force acts on the leaves the leaves also blow away from the person",3,Student 59
There is no information about the initial velocity or the final velocity so its impossible to determine anything about the velocity. The direction of the force determines the direction of acceleration as force is the cause of motion.,3,Student 13
"a = dv/dt, v = -3t^2",3,Student 11
