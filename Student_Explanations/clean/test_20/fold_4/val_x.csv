"Due to the fact that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity when looking at the parabolic shape of the velocity-time graph, it was evident that the graph started off with a negative slope, hence negative acceleration, then moved on to a positive slope, hence positive acceleration. This behavior is depicted by a linear graph.",0,Student 90
"The derivative of the velocity graph is acceleration, and the slope starts negative, is 0 at t=0, and becomes positive after that.",0,Student 87
"An acceleration graph reflects the derivative of the velocity graph. So you can ignore the displacement graph and look at the velocity. You'll find that the slope on v(t) begins negative, reaches 0, and then becomes positive. This means that the a(t) graph should begin negative, cross the x-axis, and then end positive.",0,Student 82
"Since the acceleration graph represents the slope of the velocity graph (and therefore the derivative), the acceleration graph is a positive linear graph to represent the slope of the parabola velocity graph.",0,Student 88
"The slope of the tangent line to the velocity graph before t=0 is negative, and the slope of the tangent line to the velocity graph after t=0 is positive, so it must be the option A which shows a negative value for acceleration before t=0 and a positive value for acceleration after t=0.",0,Student 85
"As acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, the slopes of the graph of velocity gives us the points for the acceleration graph. Because the velocity graph has a negative slope to the left of the (x(t))y-axis, its acceleration is negative. In the same way, the velocity on the right of the y-axis (x(t)) is positive thus the plotted points on the acceleration graph to the right of the y-axis are positive.",0,Student 9
"From the displacement and velocity curves we can analyze that the slope of the velocity curve changes from negative to positive over the interval, which aligns with the first plot.",0,Student 84
"Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, I looked at how the slope of the line tangent to the velocity graph was changing. The average velocity was first negative then became positive. So the second graph does not represent acceleration because it shows that the rate of change of velocity was positive for all time t.",0,Student 80
"I chose B because base on the left hand side of the acceleration vs. time graph, it shows that the velocity is decreasing at a non-constant speed. Right hand side of the acceleration vs. time graph, it shows that the velocity is increasing exponentially. However, for choice A, the velocity vs. time graph shows that the object acceleration increases exponentially which is not the case base on the given displacement and velocity vs. time graph.",0,Student 89
"The (magnitude of the) velocity decreases in the first half of the time period (as the curve comes down to graze the t-axis). This means that the acceleration must be negative during this time. Option A portrays negative acceleration during the first half of the time period. Option B does not. Therefore, option A must be the correct answer. (Both Option A and B are identical in the second half of the time period.)",0,Student 91
"Acceleration is the derivative of velocity. From the graph of velocity you can see that the slope is negative for t<0, 0 at t=0, and positive for t>0. This corresponds to graph A.",0,Student 94
"Since acceleration is the derivative of velocity, if we look at the velocity graph and imagine the slope of tangent lines, the slopes would be negative to the left of the origin and positive to the right of the origin. Additionally, since the velocity graph is a parabola, the acceleration graph should be linear.",0,Student 92
My reasoning was that the derivative of the velocity graph would look like the acceleration graph I chose.,0,Student 83
Both land at the same time as the horizontal velocity of the ball is not only constant but independent of the vertical velocity of the ball that undergoes the same constant acceleration of the other ball that is thrown directly up.,1,Student 90
"Because both balls are effected by the same force of gravity, it doesn't matter whether there is movement in the x direction or not, they will hit the ground at the same time. They are both getting pulled down by the same force of gravity, and therefore if they were dropped at the same time they will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 88
"The time to hit the ground for both balls is based only on the vertical component of the velocity vector. Since they are both starting from rest (V0 = 0), from the same height, and are both subject to gravity's 9.8 m/s^2 downward acceleration, they will hit the ground at the same time. The launched ball's horizontal Velocity component doesn't affect it's downward motion.",1,Student 87
"As we learned in the pre-lectures, both balls would fall and hit the ground at the same time as the only force (in this case) acting on them would be gravity an acceleration of -9.8m/s^2 (or -10 m/s^2). This seemed confusing at first because I wanted to believe that the direction (all vertical or horizontal fall) would cause the balls to land at different times, i.e. direction at which the ball is thrown makes the ball fall slower. But as I thought of the video of the person throwing the ball on the train, I was able to understand how the horizonal versus vertical fall does not cause a differing landing time.",1,Student 9
"The ball falling in the vertical component of each of the motions is solely dependent on gravity since theirs no vertical velocity for either ball. Therefore if they are dropping from the same height, and don't have any velocity they should hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 82
"The behavior of a projectile motion in the y-direction and the x-direction are independent. Therefore, if dropped from the same height both balls will hit the ground at the same time because they will have the same acceleration in vertical motion.",1,Student 80
"They hit the ground at the same time because the projectile motion of the launched ball is simply the superposition of the constant acceleration of gravity and the constant velocity in the horizontal direction. The velocity in the x direction has no bearing on the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground, it is only the gravitational acceleration that affects that. So, since both the dropped ball and the launched ball have the same downwards acceleration, they will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 85
"As discussed in the pre-lecture, since the horizontal and vertical motion of each ball are independent of each other, the balls will hit the ground at the same time because the vertical motion is dictated by g (acceleration due to gravity)",1,Student 92
"Applying the concept of projectile motion, the behavior of the first ball (projected) in the vertical direction is the same as the behavior of the second ball, because both balls start from the same height. Considering only the vertical motion with constant acceleration of the balls, both balls take the same amount of time to hit the ground, despite their difference in the horizontal motion.",1,Student 84
They will hit the ground at the same time because of super position. This means that the projectiles are the same in the vertical and horizontal direction.,1,Student 86
"The horizontal and vertical motion of the ball are independent, given the initial angle and velocity of the launch/drop/throw. Thus we can ignore the horizontal movement of the launched ball. All that matters is the height, which is the same for each ball.",1,Student 91
"Both balls will hit at the same time because they both have the same forces and initial velocity in the vertical direction. Therefore, no matter what the horizontal speed is, they will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 95
"We know that acceleration in the y direction of both of the ball is -9.8m/s^2. In order to solve for its final velocity right before it hits the ground, we can use the equation vf^2 = vi^2 + 2a(xf - xi). For both of the ball, let's say: vi = 0 ay = -9.8 m/s^2 xi = 5 m xf = 0m As we can see from this equation, the only variables that matter are vi, ay, xi, and xf. The angle at which the ball get kick ball does not matter.",1,Student 89
"Neither ball is thrown upwards, so gravity affects them both at the same rate. Therefore, they hit at the same time.",1,Student 94
"The ball dropped vertically would only have the force aiming downward (gravity) applied to it. The one thrown horizontally would have a strong force moving sideways applied to it on top of the force going downwards, so naturally it will move horizontally more while the downward force acts gradually.",1,Student 83
"Since the girl and the dog are both on the conveyor belt moving to the right at 2m/s, than the girl would see the dog coming at her at 8m/s because they're both moving left together and therefore that movement doesn't matter from the perspective of the girl.",2,Student 88
"The girl is moving along with the belt, seeing as she is stationary (standing) relative to the belt. Therefore, the dog's velocity relative to the belt is the same as the dog's velocity relative to the girl. This also makes sense using vector addition: (Vd,b + Vb,girl = Vd,girl ; 8 m/s + 0 m/s = 8 m/s).",2,Student 87
"Since the girl is standing on the belt instead of moving, what she sees is the dog running at 8m/s towards her on the belt.",2,Student 84
"Since the girl is standing still on the conveyor belt that has velocity of 2 m/s relative to the ground, wouldn't the girl have the same velocity with respect to the belt which is 2 m/s.",2,Student 89
The girl is moving at the same speed as the belt and the dog's speed was given relative to the belt.,2,Student 83
"To the woman, she is stationary and not actually moving. However as the belt moves her forwards by 2 m/s, she gets closer and closer to the dog moving towards her at 8m/s. In this case we add the velocities and the dog seemingly moves at a speed of 10 m/s.",2,Student 9
"The speed of the dog relative to the is 6 m/s as found in the question above, however, this time it is shown in the diagram that the girl is moving in the direction of the dog. From this, from the girl's point of view, it will seem as if the dog is actually moving faster than it is. Therefore, you can add the velocity of the girl relative to the ground and the dog relative to the ground.",2,Student 90
"Here, we again combine the two vectors to get our answer, but we have 8m/s + 2m/s = 10m/s. The difference is that the two vectors are working together to shorten the distance.",2,Student 91
"The girl is standing on the belt and is not moving on the belt. But since the dog is, its speed will be 8m/s relative to the girl.",2,Student 86
"The girl is moving towards the dog, so the dog will catch her sooner than he would if she was still on the ground. Therefore, the dog is moving faster relative to the girl by 2 m/s, which is the speed of the conveyor belt.",2,Student 95
"Since the girl is on the floor/belt, the velocity of the dog is the same when its relative to her as well. The women would see the dog going at her at 6m/s.",2,Student 82
"Since the dog and the girl are moving toward each other, combining the velocity vectors will give the speed of the dog relative to the girl.",2,Student 85
"Since the velocity vector relating the girl to the belt is 0 m/s, and we add that vector to the vector relating the dog to the belt, the resultant velocity vector moves 8 m/s in the negative direction",2,Student 92
"The girl is at rest on the moving walkway; for the purposes of evaluating movement, she is essentially an extension of the belt. The dog's speed relative to her is the same as its speed relative to the belt.",2,Student 94
To the girl the dog appears to be moving at 6 m/s.,2,Student 80
"The net force determines the direction of acceleration, therefore the acceleration of the box must be in the positive x-direction. However, the object's velocity (both direction and magnitude are not known, because the object could have started at a velocity, in any direction. Acceleration only indicates the direction of the change in velocity. For example, if the box was already moving at a constant velocity in the negative y-direction, its positive x acceleration would turn to shift the box's velocity to have an increasing (with time) velocity in the x-direction in addition to the negative y velocity it started with. Therefore the combined velocity at any given point would have both a negative y component and a positive x component, but it wouldn't ever be parallel to the x-axis (in this example).",3,Student 87
"The acceleration of the box is parallel to the x axis because force is reliant on mass and acceleration, and in order for the box to accelerate there must be forces acting upon it. Therefore, if the net force is in the positive x direction the acceleration will be parallel to the x axis.",3,Student 88
Force creates acceleration which then creates velocity in the object. Velocity and acceleration vectors result from force meaning they must have the same direction parallel to the x-axis.,3,Student 82
"Based on Newton's second law, accelerations are caused by forces, and the acceleration of an object will have the same direction as the net force applied to that object, thus acceleration is indeed parallel to x axis in the information given. In addition, since acceleration describes the change of velocity with respect to the change in time and momentum is the object's velocity times a factor of object's mass, there is relation between the acceleration vector and the quantity of momentum. The velocity will be parallel to the x axis considering the direction of the net force. However, there isn't enough information given to conclude whether the velocity is in the positive x direction or the negative x direction, as it can be negative but parallel to the x axis as well.",3,Student 84
"There is no stated initial velocity, so the velocity vector's direction is unknown. However, if the net force is in the x direction, the acceleration must be going that direction too.",3,Student 95
"The acceleration of an object is caused by the force on that object. So, if the net force is in the positive x direction, that means the acceleration will be too. Further, acceleration is a change in velocity over time, so velocity must also be in the same direction. I’m a little confused, though, because I think that the box could be moving at a constant velocity in the negative x direction and still have an acceleration in the positive x direction due to a net force in that direction, which would just mean that its motion would be in the negative x direction but it would be slowing down. However, I think this would still mean that both velocity and acceleration are PARALLEL to the x axis. I also think the question is kind of confusing, because couldn't the force on the box be in the positive x direction while and the positive y direction, moving at an angle to the x axis, not parallel? I feel like C is maybe the best answer, but I can't really pin down why. It's kind of a gut feeling, but it also seems too easy.",3,Student 85
"Acceleration will act in the same way that the force on the box does. Since, the box is moving in the positive x direction, acceleration will do the same so acceleration is parallel to the x axis",3,Student 86
"If a 3 people were pushing the box but one person was pushing harder than the rest, the box would accelerate in the same direction as the greater force. However, with velocity, the final velocity has to take into account the initial velocity. Though the acceleration might go to the right, if the velocity was going upwards, the box might move at a slant.",3,Student 9
"It is not necessary for a velocity to be parallel to the x-axis, since by Newton's Second Law, F=m*a. What matters here is a-acceleration",3,Student 93
"Acceleration is equal to force divided by mass. Mass won't affect the direction of the force, so acceleration and force must be in the same direction.",3,Student 94
"If a force is being exerted win the positive direction, the acceleration has to be positive given the formula F=ma (mass can't be negative) and if the acceleration is positive, so is the velocity",3,Student 92
"Based on newton's second, we know that fnet is mass(acceleration). Since we know that fnet is positive in the x direction, we can also say that it's acceleration has to be greater than 0. But does that also means if the acceleration is positive, would the velocity also be positive?",3,Student 89
"Since the force is in the positive direction, then its acceleration must be as well. Therefore, if its acceleration is in the positive direction, so is its velocity.",3,Student 83
The acceleration is parallel to the x-axis as the force and the acceleration are directly related.,3,Student 90
"It need not be moving in the positive x direction (yet). The force on it may not be sufficient to have changed its direction, if it was previously going a direction direction. But, it must at least be accelerating in the positive x direction. That is, its velocity is changing in that direction, gradually.",3,Student 91
