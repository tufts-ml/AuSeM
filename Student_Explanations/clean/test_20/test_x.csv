"The first acceleration vs. time graph indicates that the velocity decreases before t=0 and then increases in the opposite direction after t=0. The second graph indicates that the velocity increases throughout the time period, but at a decreasing rate before t=0 and at an increasing rate after t=0. The first graph must represent this scenario since the velocity vs. time graph depicts a decreasing velocity before t=0.",0,Student 4
"Considering the calculus behind these graphs, I could tell that since the velocity graph was a quadratic equation, then the resulting derivative would be linear. Using my knowledge of Physics, I know that the acceleration is negative when time is negative and positive when time is positive.",0,Student 54
"Since acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function, I looked at the slope of the velocity function to choose my answer. When t < 0, the slope of v(t) is negative so the a(t) should be below the x axis which is it in the first option.",0,Student 81
"Based on the velocity graph, starting with the left side, we see that the velocity is decreasing in magnitude and has a negative slope, so it's moving towards the left (the negative side). This indicates that the acceleration is also decreasing in magnitude but since the car is heading towards the negative side (left) we know that the acceleration has to be going the opposite direction for the care to be slowing down, so in this case the acceleration would be decreasing in magnitude but have a positive slope. And for the right side of the graph, we see that the velocity is increasing in magnitude and has a positive slope, meaning it is going faster in the positive direction, so the acceleration has to be increasing in magnitude and also going towards the positive direction (right).",0,Student 24
"I mainly looked at the velocity graph and determined the sign for the slopes before and after t=0. When t<0, its slope (acceleration, which is change in velocity per unit of time) is <0. When t>0, its slope is >0. Therefore, when transferring this on an acceleration vs. time graph, the acceleration values at t<0 will be negative, and the acceleration values at t>0 will be positive. The second option for this answer would indicate that the acceleration is always positive, which is not the case. Therefore, I believe the first option is correct.",0,Student 48
"The first graph is better because it displays a portion of negative acceleration, while the other graph does not. Velocity decreases from -t to 0, so therefor the acceleration must be negative.",0,Student 33
"The acceleration can be deduced from the derivative of the velocity since the change in velocity is the acceleration. On the left side of the y-axis on the velocity graph, the change in velocity is negative. Therefore the left side of the y-axis on the acceleration graph should be negative. On the right side of the y-axis on the velocity graph, the change in velocity is positive. Therefore the right side of the y-axis on the acceleration graph should be positive.",0,Student 10
"As the position reaches zero, the velocity slows down to become zero m/s and then proceeds to increase again. Since the velocity behaves this way, the acceleration graph must look like a V-shape because the negative acceleration (because the object was slowing down,) is getting closer to zero and becomes zero, and then the positive acceleration (because the object was speeding up,) continues increasing.",0,Student 42
"The graph that I chose is best represents the acceleration curve associated with the displacement because the velocity decreases and increases, so there has to be at least a part of the graph that has to be negative in the third quadrant. So by looking at both graphs there was a clear graph that showed the relationship better.",0,Student 41
"As velocity approaches 0, the object would be slowing down and have a negative acceleration. The area under the velocity curve is the acceleration which matches with B.",0,Student 72
"In this question, the velocity is demonstrated to slow down to 0,0 and then, at the same rate, increase back to the original speed. This is demonstrated in the second acceleration graph as the rates of change are reflected over the a(t) axis.",0,Student 39
"The slope of velocity starts negative, is 0, and then is positive.",0,Student 26
"Referring back to my notes, acceleration is how fast the velocity is changing, which also means the derivative of the velocity is acceleration. If one were to take the derivative of the velocity graph shown, one would get a graph looking like option B.",0,Student 53
"On the left side of the graph, since the slope of the velocity is negative, the acceleration on the left side of the graph must also be negative.",0,Student 44
I choose this answer because the displacement was becoming exponentially negative,0,Student 49
"Acceleration can be represented by the slope of the tangent line of at each point in time in the velocity function, since it is the time derivative of velocity. Therefore, the graph of the acceleration is the slope of velocity at each point in time (where time is represented by the x-axis). Since velocity is the derivative of displacement, the acceleration graph represents the second derivative of displacement.",0,Student 101
"Acceleration is defined as the change in velocity over a period of time (slope). In the graph of the velocity, it is shown that the velocity is always positive; however, to the left of the origin, the slope of the velocity is negative. This means that the acceleration will be negative to the left of the origin, but as acceleration gets closer to the origin it becomes 0 m/s^2 because the change in the velocity becomes 0 (indicated by the flat line in the graph). Then, to the right of the origin in the graph of the velocity the slope becomes positive, resulting in a positive acceleration.",0,Student 56
"1. I can see from the second graph that as velocity is decreasing before t reaches 0, it does so at a continuously slower rate, which can be seen in the gradual flattening of the curve, meaning that the acceleration is positive. Only the correct option for the graph of the acceleration curve shows the acceleration curve increasing when t is less than 0. 2. I recognize the first graph as x(t)=t^3. Thus, v(t)=(d(t^3))/dt which works out to v(t)=t^2, also clearly shown in the graph. Doing the same thing for acceleration, a(t)=t, the graph of which is the one I chose.",0,Student 70
"The acceleration function is simply rewritten as the derivative of the velocity function. Therefore, the graph for a(t) is the values of the slopes of the v(t) curve at each point. On the velocity curve, the slopes progressively increase (get closer to 0) but are negative, and then increase and are positive. This exactly matches the acceleration line, it increases the entire time but starts off negative and ends up positive.",0,Student 79
"Since the graph of acceleration over time is the slope of velocity over time, I looked at the slope of the velocity graph. It shows that velocity has a negative slope when x is less than 0 and a positive slope when x is more than zero. The first acceleration graph (which resembles a graph of y = x) corresponds to this because the y values (acceleration at specific times) are negative left of the origin and positive right of the origin.",0,Student 18
"Projectile motion can be understood as the motion of free-fall objects on a constant moving platform with the train example. This question proves that the time it takes for a ball falling from it's highest point to reach the ground, regardless of horizontal displacement, is the same.",1,Student 39
"In the lecture videos it described the X and y components of an object as independent, since the balls are being released from the same height, their time in the air will be the same, despite one of the balls also moving horizontally.",1,Student 81
"Since vertical and horizontal motion are independent of each other, and both balls are being dropped/launched at the same height, they will hit the ground simultaneously.",1,Student 42
"I believe that both balls will hit at the same time because the velocity of the balls does not matter in the case of which ball will hit the ground first. Since gravity is acting on both of the balls, they will both hit the ground at the same time because are decreasing altitude by 9.8 m/s2.",1,Student 41
"The only force acting on the balls is the gravitational pull of 10 m/s^2 (in the vertical direction) and since they are being released from the same height, they should hit the ground at the same time. I was initially confused because if you were to look at the distance that was going to be traveled by the two balls, the one being thrown horizontally would be travelling the longest distance, so one would think that it would take longer to hit the ground.",1,Student 24
"If you consider the vertical motion of the ball launched horizontally, it has the same vector as the ball dropped vertically. If the ball was launched even harder with a larger initial horizontal velocity, the ball would still hit at the same time.",1,Student 54
"The vertical components of Vo are equal, so their vertical motion is equal.",1,Student 26
"We know that both balls have an initial vertical velocity of 0 m/s and a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2. Vertical velocity determines the time the balls spend in the air. When comparing this to the equation ""vertical distance = (viy)t + 0.5at^2"", since both the initial vertical velocity, vertical distance, and gravity values are equal, the time at which the balls hit the ground will also be equal.",1,Student 48
"As we learned in the pre-lecture videos, the vertical component of the ball’s motion is completely independent from the horizontal component. As such, the vertical “falling” of the second ball, even though it is moving horizontally, moves vertically just the same as the ball with no horizontal velocity. It is important to note, this is true only if the two balls have the same initial vertical velocity, which, in this case, is zero.",1,Student 44
"They hit the ground first because they both have the same initial velocity and the same constant acceleration as well as the same height. With all of these variables being the same, t(final) should also be the same.",1,Student 72
"Regardless of the horizontal motion of the launched ball, the vertical acceleration as soon as it leaves the support of the platform is -g, which is the same as the dropped ball. Since they start from the same height and accelerate downward at the same rate, the two balls will hit the ground simultaneously.",1,Student 70
"The balls will hit the ground at the same time. This is because the only factor that determines when the balls will hit the ground is the velocity and acceleration in the y direction. Each balls initial y velocity will be equal, and because the acceleration in the y direction is equal for both balls, they will travel the same distance vertically in the same amount of time.",1,Student 33
"When objects are in free fall, as the balls above are, they all experience the same downward acceleration. Both balls are being 'pulled' down at the same rate. Although it may seem like the ball launched horizontally would take longer, it shouldn't because horizontal and vertical motion act independently of one another. The ball's horizontal motion does not impede gravity from acting the same way it does on the ball dropped vertically. Therefore, the balls should hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 10
"When determining which ball hits the ground first, we must consider the vertical component independently from the horizontal component. Therefore, because the balls are dropped from the same height, they will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 101
"The only force acting on the two balls once they are dropped/launched is gravity. The vertical acceleration and velocity of the balls are independent from their horizontal velocity, so one ball being launched in a horizontal direction will still experience the same acceleration and hit the ground at the same time as its dropped counterpart, since they both start with a vertical velocity of zero.",1,Student 4
They would land on the ground at the same time because the speed at which they fall is not affected by their distance in the x axis,1,Student 49
"The two balls hit the ground at the same time because the vertical component and the horizontal component of the fall are independent of each other, meaning one does not affect the other. Since they fall from the same height their vertical components are the same.",1,Student 56
"It's weird to think about in a literal sense but if you split the motions up into x and y directions it becomes clear they are moving the same amount downwards, so the distance travelled horizontally won't impact the time they hit the ground.",1,Student 53
"The x and y equations of motion, or horizontal and vertical vectors, are completely separate from each other. No matter how fast an object is moving in the horizontal (x) motion, its behavior in the vertical motion will remain the same. Objects that start at the same height will hit the ground at the exact same time regardless of difference in horizontal motion as they are both affected by the same constant acceleration (g).",1,Student 79
"Horizontal motion is independent of vertical motion, thus the fact that the second ball is launched horizontally doesn't create a difference in vertical motion from the first ball. Since they both experience acceleration towards the ground at the same rate, they will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 18
"The dog's speed relative to the girl would be 8 m/s because she is also on the conveyer belt. This means that they both relative to the belt, which in other words means that they share the same reference frame, so they see the same speeds that objects move at.",2,Student 42
"Again, the way I processed this question was by first identifying that this is happening at a 1D level. Therefore, we can employ the idea of V vector a,c = V vector a,b + V vector b,c; in this case, it was V vector dog,girl = V vector girl,belt + V vector dog,belt, where V vector dog,girl = 0 m/s - 8 m/s. This lead to -8 m/s being the velocity of the dog in relation to the ground (or 8 m/s in the negative direction). The girl's velocity in relation to the belt is 0 m/s because she is simply standing on it.",2,Student 48
"The girl is not moving in respect to the belt so that would be 0 m/s. The dog is moving 8 m/s. When we are thinking about the speed of the dog relative to the girl, we are only concerned with the dogs speed relative to the belt and the girls speed relative to the belt for our addition. So we add 0 m/s to 8 m/s to get 8 m/s as the speed of the dog relative to the girl.",2,Student 72
The speed of the dog relative to the girl is the same as the dog relative to the belt since the girl is standing still on the belt,2,Student 4
"To be honest, I am struggling with applying the math to this situation. Playing the situation out in my head, I know that the person's movement along the conveyor belt makes her move closer to the dog faster, so the 2m/s of the conveyor belt is added to the 8m/s of the dog's motion toward her, but I don't know how to reconcile assigning positive values to two diametrically opposed motions.",2,Student 70
"Since the girl is not moving with respect to the belt, but both the dog and the girl are moving on the belt with respect to the ground, the speed of the dog is 8 m/s.",2,Student 81
"If the woman is already moving forward at a pace of 2 mph and there is a dog running towards her at 8 mph if you were to think about them moving on a non-moving surface it would feel as though the dog was traveling at her at a speed of 10 mph. If this was to happen on solid ground, but instead the woman was talking 2 mph forward, and the dog was running forward 8 mph, the result would be the same.",2,Student 54
"For this question we are looking for the speed of the dog relative to the girl, we know that the speed of the dog relative to the belt is 8 m/s and the speed of the girl is the same as the conveyer belt since she is standing (not moving) which is 2 m/s, so we would add both getting an answer of 10 m/s.",2,Student 24
"in this case, since the girl's velocity relative to the belt is 0, and the dog's velocity relative to the belt is -8m/s the speed of the dog relative to the girl is |-8m/s|",2,Student 44
"Because V(A, B) = V(A, C) + V(C, B); V(dog, girl) = V(dog, belt) + V(belt, girl) Thus V(dog, girl) = (-8 m/s) + (0 m/s) = -8 m/s",2,Student 39
The girl is moving to the dog at 2m/s and the dog is moving to the girl at 8m/s so you combine the two forces to get 10m/s,2,Student 49
You would add the 8 m/s and 2/s because they are both coming together towards each other. This would result in a velocity of 10 m/s.,2,Student 53
"The answer would be 8m/s because the girl is moving at the same speed as the, and the velocity of 8 m/s of the dog relative of the belt should be interchangeable with the speed of the dog with respect to the girl.",2,Student 33
"Both the dog and the girl are moving with the belt, so the movement of the belt does not influence the dog relative to the girl. Therefore, the dog is moving 8 m/s relative to the girl.",2,Student 101
I believe that the answer is 10 m/s because since the lady is getting closer to the dog at 2 m/s and the dog is getting closer to her at 8m/s from the perspective of the lady the dog is coming at 8 m/s because every second she is getting 2 m/s closer.,2,Student 41
"The speed of the dog relative to the girl is 8 m/s. The speed of the dog relative to the belt is 8 m/s and the speed of the belt relative to the girl is 0 m/s (because the girl stands on the belt, moving at the same velocity as the belt moves with respect to the ground). When those are added together, it results in 8 m/s.",2,Student 56
The dog and the girl are both on the conveyor belt. The velocity of the dog would be equal to the velocity of the dog with respect to the belt and the belt with respect to the girl. The girl is standing still which would be a vector of magnitude 0 plus the dog's velocity vector os 8 m/s to the left which gives 8 m/s to the left.,2,Student 10
"Relative to the girl, the dog is moving at a speed of 8 meters per second. This was was really tricky to understand at first, because the first thing that comes to my mind is including the speed of the belt. What's so important to understand is that relative to the belt, the girl is not moving. She's staying still relative to the belt while the dog is moving at a velocity of 8 meters per second in the opposite direction relative to the belt. Both the dog and the girl are on the moving belt, so this speed will not affect the velocity of the dog relative to the girl. So, if the girl is not moving (in relativity to the belt) and has a velocity of 0 m/s and the dog is moving at a speed of 8 m/s in relation to the belt, we can conclude that the dog is moving at a speed of 8 meters per second relative to the girl.",2,Student 79
"Since the girl is moving 2 m/s back with the conveyor belt, and from her reference frame she is not moving, the velocity of the dog is not affected by the velocity of the conveyor belt. Thus the dog is moving 8 m/s toward the girl.",2,Student 18
The girl is on the conveyor belt so she is moving at the speed of the conveyor belt relative to the ground so the speed of the dog relative to the belt should be equal to the speed of the dog relative to the girl.,2,Student 26
"We do not know the box's initial velocity, so we can't know if its velocity is parallel to the x axis, but the force vector is proportional to the acceleration vector, so the acceleration will be parallel to the x axis if the force is in the positive x direction.",3,Student 4
"Acceleration is parallel to the x axis because acceleration is directly proportional to the Fnet, so it would make sense that they are parallel (F = ma). Acceleration is dv/dt, which would place velocity in a way I honestly don't know how to deduce. I'm almost trying to think of a car crash coming from the West side. I think the acceleration would be towards the center, but the velocity of the car would go North east opposite to that... but I'm not quite sure.",3,Student 48
"the net force on an object is equal to the mass times the acceleration vector of that object. If the net force vector is in the positive x direction then so is the acceleration. An object can be accelerating in that direction, but the velocity of the object is not stated in this problem, so the initial velocity might have been in a different direction, causing the velocity in the moment to not be parallel to the x axis.",3,Student 81
"While the velocity could be in any direction, this positive x force means we ware pushing it in the x direction, meaning it’s acceleration is parallel to the x axis",3,Student 44
"Since net force causes acceleration, the net force and acceleration vectors point in the same direction. This means that the change in velocity is parallel to the x-axis, but without knowing the initial condition of the box, it is impossible to tell which direction the velocity points in. Depending on the acceleration is due to only a change in magnitude of the velocity or if it includes a change in direction, the velocity could or could not point in the same direction as the acceleration.",3,Student 70
"I'm not entirely sure if the velocity would be parallel to the x-axis, becuase velocity can also be perpendicular to the x-axis, or in other words parallel to the y-axis. But, since the net force is in the positive x direction, then the acceleration should be in the same direction, since force causes acceleration as discussed in the prelecture videos.",3,Student 24
"As we saw in Newton's Second Law, forces cause change in velocity in an object, also known as acceleration. So, forces cause acceleration. The net forces which act upon an object are directly related to the object's acceleration. This means that the force and acceleration vectors are pointed in the same direction. We aren't sure about velocity though, so I didn't want to include that answer as well...",3,Student 79
"Newton's second law demonstrates that acceleration is in the same direction as force. For this to be true, velocity does not necessarily need to be in the same direction. Although the total net force is in the positive direction, there are more than one forces in consideration and these forces are not necessarily in the positive x direction. There could another force in the negative direction which means it has its own acceleration vector going in the negative direction. Just because the sum of the forces are a positive value, does not mean that there are no negative forces with negative accelerations at play.",3,Student 72
"Since the acceleration is determined by the force/mass and mass is only a scalar quantity and not a vector, then the acceleration vector will have the same direction as the force. We know that the force vector is parallel to the x-axis so the acceleration is as well. if the box started at rest then the velocity have the same direction as the acceleration, but we were not given that initial condition, so there is no way to know if the change in velocity is equal in direction to the initial velocity.",3,Student 54
"Since the net force on a box is in the positive x direction, its acceleration must also be in the positive x direction because force causes acceleration so the direction of force equals the direction of acceleration. Intuitively, if the net force on a box is in the positive x direction, the box must be moving in the positive x direction, which would mean the velocity vector should be parallel to the x axis.",3,Student 26
"I think you can invoke newton's second law that related mass, force, and acceleration. The magnitude of acceleration is proportional to the force. The force causes an object to accelerate in the direction of the force. If you apply a force to an object, it will cause a change in motion (start/stop/slow down/speed up) and it makes sense the direction of the force would be the same as the acceleration. Pushing a box to the left (applying a leftward force) should cause it to move to the left.",3,Student 10
"If the force is acting on it in the positive x direction, then the box must be moving in the positive x direction and will therefore have a parallel acceleration to the x axis since it is not speeding up. The velocity would also be parallel because its direction is positive. I disagree with myself as I type this but I'm not sure what my opposing argument is.",3,Student 53
"If the net force on a box is in the positive x-direction, then the box moves in that direction. As force is something that causes objects to accelerate, this indicates the box's acceleration is parallel to the x-axis. Furthermore, if acceleration is the change of velocity then the velocity must be parallel to the x-axis.",3,Student 56
"Its Acceleration is parallel to the x axis because acceleration will always point in the same direction as F. This relationship is described using the equation F=ma. Because mass is constant, the force and acceleration will always point in the same direction, and because net force is parallel to the x-axis, acceleration will be too. Velocity may or may not be parallel, but it is impossible to know if one does not know if the box is moving already or not.",3,Student 33
"Since the box is moving in the positive direction, the velocity is moving parallel to the x axis because it's increasing.",3,Student 42
The acceleration would be parallel to the x-axis because the net force is staying the same. The velocity would keep accelerating therefore it would not be parallel.,3,Student 49
The velocity is parallel to the x-axis because whereever the direction of the poitive x is going the box is going to be moving with it making it parallel to the direction that it is getting pushed. The velocity has to be increasing if it is going in the positive direction.,3,Student 41
"The acceleration would be parallel to the x-axis because the force causes the acceleration, and like the video explains, the direction of the force and acceleration are always the same. The force is directly related to the change in velocity/acceleration in this sense, but not the velocity itself, which is why the velocity doesn't necessarily have to be in a specific direction.",3,Student 18
"In Newton's 2nd Law, he states that the direction of the force equals the direction of acceleration equals the direction of CHANGE in velocity.",3,Student 39
"force causes acceleration, they are proportional based on mass (constant of proportionality), so a force in the positive x direction will cause acceleration in the same direction (which is parallel to x-axis)",3,Student 101
