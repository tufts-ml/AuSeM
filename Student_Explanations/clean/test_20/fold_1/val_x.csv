"The function for acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function. This means that the acceleration graph comprises of many different instantaneous slopes on the velocity graph. Since velocity is decreasing when t<0, this means that the slope is negative, and the graph for acceleration will have to go below the x-axis when t<0.",0,Student 28
"The acceleration curve can be derived from the velocity curve. Since the velocity curve starts negative and gradually becomes more positive, the first graph represents its acceleration.",0,Student 29
"Because the slope of velocity is decreasing when t<0, then the slope = 0 at t=0 and then the slope is increasing when t >0, the acceleration must show this as well because the slope of the velocity = acceleration. The second graph has a slope of 0 at t=0 so it must be this one.",0,Student 27
"I chose answer A because in the graph of velocity versus time, the slope of the line to the left of the y-axis is decreasing, and the slope of the line to the right of the y-axis is increasing. This means that in the graph of acceleration versus time that the line would have to be below the x-axis for values left of the y-axis and above the x-axis for values to the right of the y-axis. This correlates to graph A and not graph B.",0,Student 34
"I chose the first acceleration graph because if you take the instantaneous velocity from the curve, or basically look at the slope of the velocity curve, when x is less than 0, the slope is negative. This means that the points on the acceleration curve must be negative when x is less than 0. That is only true for the first acceleration graph.",0,Student 35
"According to the definition, acceleration is the time rate of change of velocity, therefore acceleration is equal to the derivative of velocity, which means the acceleration at a certain time t is the slope of the v-t graph at that time. The graph of acceleration can be drawn by plotting the slope of the v-t graph at each time point. As in the v-t graph above, the velocity is decreasing with a declining rate, and until it's reached zero, it starts to increase with a growing rate. As a result, the acceleration should generally increase from negative to positive.",0,Student 23
"As acceleration is equal to the derivative of velocity, and the slope of the velocity graph is negative for t<0, then the acceleration vs time graph must have a section that is below the time axis, indicating a negative acceleration.",0,Student 37
"Acceleration is the slope of the velocity graph. Thus, the acceleration curve should begin as negative given that the velocity graph has a negative slope until it hits the origin, and after that the acceleration becomes positive as velocity curves back upwards. Option A is the only graph where the acceleration is negative in the beginning, so I chose it as the correct answer.",0,Student 38
"Acceleration is the derivative of velocity. The velocity is slowing down when x is less than 0, which indicates a negative acceleration. The velocity is then 0 at the point (0,0) and starts to increase, meaning that there is a positive acceleration. The graph that I chose displays a negative velocity before (0,0) and then a positive velocity after.",0,Student 40
"As seen in the velocity v. time graph, the slope of the quadratic curve is negative in approaching the origin (0,0) and positive following the origin. As such, because the acceleration is the slope, or derivative, of the velocity and the second derivative of the position, the acceleration is negative approaching the origin and positive following the origin.",0,Student 3
"If acceleration is equal to the derivative of the velocity (slope of the v vs. t graph) option a would be correct. If you take the derivative at certain increments from the negatives to 0 on the v vs. t graph you see the derivative goes from being more negative until it reaches 0. then, if you take the derivative from 0 to the positives you can see the derivative goes from 0 to increasingly positive. This data matches with graph A showing a line that goes from more negative to 0 to more positive.",0,Student 36
"On the left side of the velocity graph the object is slowing down but never goes backwards. The top graph shows the object having negative and positive acceleration, while the bottom graph only show positive acceleration.",0,Student 32
"Since the acceleration is the slope of the velocity vs time graph, we can see that the slope of the velocity vs time graph is negative as the function is decreasing towards zero. This trend is reflected in acceleration graph that I selected. Likewise when the function in the velocity-time graph is increasing, a positive acceleration is observed in the acceleration graph as the slope is positive.",0,Student 30
"I chose this because acceleration is derived by taking the derivative of velocity. By taking the derivative of a quadratic velocity function, the resulting acceleration function will be linear.",0,Student 25
"They hit the ground at the same time because vertical motion behaves independently of horizontal motion, and they both have the same vertical acceleration, initial velocity, and initial and final displacement.",1,Student 29
"The horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent of each other. Since the two balls with the same initial velocity (which is zero) are launched at exactly the same time, and experience free-fall in the vertical direction with the acceleration of g=9.8m/s^2, they should hit the ground at the same time, no matter the initial speed given horizontally on the second ball.",1,Student 23
"The x and y components are completely independent of each other for both balls. Since both balls have the same initial height, and once they are in the air, the only force acting upon them is gravity, they will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 34
"Since the balls are dropped and launched from the same height, they will both hit at the same time because the only acceleration acting on them is gravity. The horizontal velocities of the balls do not matter because the vertical and horizontal projectiles are independent",1,Student 27
"The balls will hit the ground at the same time because the ball that is being launched is being launched in the x direction. Therefore, the velocity in the y direction will be equal to that of the ball that is dropped off of the platform. No additional force is being applied to the y direction of the launched ball that will alter the rate at which it falls.",1,Student 3
"Since both balls leave the platform at the same time and both begin with a velocity in the y-direction of 0, they will reach the ground at the same time; gravity is the only force acting on both objects in the y-direction, so both balls will have the same y-velocity at every point in their respective trajectories.",1,Student 31
"How quickly the ball drops to the floor depends on the acceleration, initial height, and initial velocity of the balls in the y-direction. Both balls have an initial velocity of 0 unit/s: the dropped ball is let go from rest and the launched ball has no initial vertical velocity since its initial velocity is only put in the horizontal direction. Furthermore, the acceleration that both balls will have is the same since they are both only acted upon by gravity, which is the same everywhere. The picture also shows that the initial height of the ball is the same. Therefore, the balls will land at the same time.",1,Student 28
"I said that both balls hit the ground at the same time because of the principal of superposition. Horizontal motion and vertical motion are completely independent of one another, so it doesn't matter that the second ball was thrown horizontally. We only want to think about the VERTICAL motion of the balls, which remains unchanged in both scenarios, and thus they'd hit the ground at the same time because the only force acting on them is acceleration due to gravity, at least in the y direction.",1,Student 38
"Because perpendicular vectors don't affect each other, as long as both initial velocities in the y direction are 0, acceleration due to gravity should affect both projectiles in the same manner and will cause them to fall to the ground at the same time.",1,Student 37
"Since the only force acting on both of the balls is the force of gravity, both have an acceleration of -9.8 m/s^2. When the balls are dropped from the same height and have the same acceleration, they will travel the vertical displacement in the same amount of time. Even though one of the balls has a horizontal displacement in addition to a vertical displacement, the fact that the ball is traveling horizontally too does not affect the time it will take for the ball to hit the ground, only the horizontal distance traveled.",1,Student 40
"The vertical motion of both balls are the same, and although they may have different starting velocities, their downward acceleration is the same (gravity) which means that their velocity will be 0 at the same time and this is when they will hit the ground.",1,Student 35
Both of the balls have the same vertical velocity ( because the thrown object is thrown with horizontal velocity and not vertical velocity). Because they have the same vertical velocity they will hit the ground at the same time. The thrown ball goes farther in the x direction because of the horizontal velocity.,1,Student 36
"The vertical vector and horizontal vector have no effect on each other. Both balls start at the same height have the same downwards acceleration, so they will hit the ground at the same time",1,Student 32
The two balls hit the ground at the same time because they are both accelerating due to gravity in the vertical direction. The horizontal motion of the balls are inconsequential to the change in the vertical height of the balls.,1,Student 30
"Honestly I thought of the example of the bullet leaving the gun in the pre-lecture video. Even though one of the bullets was being shot out of a gun and the other it was being dropped straight down, they're being dropped at the same height. Because of vertical motion and horizontal motion are independent of each other, and the fact that the balls are being dropped from the same height, they will hit the floor at the same time.",1,Student 25
"They both have the same constant acceleration (-10 m/s^2) in the y direction, an thus will hit the ground at the same time.",1,Student 22
"If the belt (and thus the girl) is moving 2m/s in the positive direction relative to the ground and the dog is moving 6m/s in the negative direction relative to the ground, the girl and the distance between the girl and the dog is decreasing at the are of the sum of the speeds of the girl and the dog. And thus, the dog is moving at a speed of 6m/s + 2m/s = 8m/s relative to the girl.",2,Student 31
"The dog is moving at a speed of 8 relative to the girl, because it is moving at a speed of 8 relative to belt, which is moving at the same speed as the girl.",2,Student 29
"Since the girl is moving toward the dog at 2m/s with the conveyor belt, and the dog is moving 8m/s toward the girl, the dog will be going 10m/s relative to the girl.",2,Student 34
"From the girl's perspective she is stationary, therefore the dog will be moving towards her at 8 m/s plus the speed at which the girl is moving so 10 m/s. Suppose the girl and the dog are 10 m apart, then it will take 1 second for the dog to cover 8 m and in that same time the girl would have covered 2 m so from the girl's perspective the dog covered that 10 m in 1 second. Thus, the dog's speed from the perspective of the girl is 10 m/s",2,Student 30
"The girl is standing at rest on the belt. The dog is moving at 8m/s on the belt. Since they are both on the same surface, we can assume that the belt acts as a ""ground"". Therefore, the dog moves 8m/s faster than the girl.",2,Student 28
"Because both the girl and the dog are moving 2 m/s on the belt, the dog's speed is 8 m/s relative to the girl, as there is no need to take into account the 2 m/s that the girl and the dog are moving at.",2,Student 37
"Because the girl is standing still on the belt, she can be simply regarded as a point on the belt, which moves at 2m/s to the right. As the dog is moving at 8m/s to the left relative to the belt, it should be also moving at 8m/s to the right relative to the girl as they take the same reference frame, which is the belt.",2,Student 23
You have to add the two velocities and the girl is moving 8 m/s and the dog is moving -2 m/s which means the speed of the dog relative to the ground in 6 m/s.,2,Student 35
"The girl moves at an equal rate as the belt. Therefore her speed relative to the belt is 0 m/s. The speed of the dog relative to the belt is 8 m/s. Taking the sum of the two speeds, one finds that the speed of the dog relative to the girl is 8 m/s.",2,Student 3
"Because the dog and the girl are on the same surface and the girl is standing still, the dog is running at 8 m/s towards the girl because even though the dog is getting ""pushed back"", the girl is getting pushed back at the same rate.",2,Student 27
"The girl is standing on the belt, so the dog's speed relative to the girl will be the same os the dog's speed relative to the belt",2,Student 32
"I chose 8 m/s because I applied the same formula here. To find the velocity of the dog relative to the girl, we have to add the velocity of the dog relative to the belt, and the velocity of the belt relative to the girl. We know the dog's velocity relative to the belt is -8m/s, and the girl is standing stationary on the belt, thus making the belt's velocity relative to the girl 0 m/s. If we add these, we still get 8 m/s.",2,Student 38
"The velocity of the dog relative to the girl is equal to the velocity of the dog relative to the belt plus the velocity of the belt relative to the girl. The velocity of the dog relative to the belt is 8 and the velocity of the belt relative to the girl is 0 (because the belt and the girl are moving at the same speed and direction. So, since 8+0=8, the speed of the dog relative to the girl is 8 m/s.",2,Student 40
"Even though the view point changed, the movement of the belt will still effect the speed of the dog, so it will look like the dog has a velocity of 6 m/s.",2,Student 25
"The relative velocity equation can also be used in this situation. The relative speed of the dog to the girl is equal to the sum of the velocity of the dog on the belt and the velocity of the belt on the girl. Since the girl is not moving on the belt, her velocity is 0, making the sum 8 + 0 = 8 m/s.",2,Student 22
She's just watching the dog. So she sees how fast he is moving regardless of the effect of the walkway because they're both on it.,2,Student 36
"We know nothing about the velocity of the box, so we cannot make any statements about the velocity's direction. However, we know through Newton's second law that the direction of the net force on an object is the same direction as the object's acceleration. The net force on the box is in the positive x direction, so we know that the acceleration of the box is parallel to the x-axis.",3,Student 34
"The net force (which is the force that determines an object's direction of acceleration) is moving in the positive x direction, meaning that the acceleration will also be in the positive x direction. However, the velocity does not necessarily have to be in the x direction. Depending on the time that you are measuring an object's velocity, it can move in any direction, although it will eventually go in the direction of the x-axis if. this force is continually exerted.",3,Student 28
"The box is accelerating in the x direction because force and acceleration are always in the same direction. However, the force could be in a different direction from the velocity if the box had already been moving in the negative x direction.",3,Student 29
"According to Newton's second law, the acceleration is provided by the net force acting on an object, which means the acceleration will have the same direction as the net force. Therefore, the acceleration is parallel to the x-axis. However, the velocity of the box could have any directions, because it could be a property that the box originally has, and it does not have to be parallel to the net force acting on the box.",3,Student 23
"Newton's second law states that F=ma so the force parallel to the x axis will equal the acceleration parallel to the x axis. Acceleration is the change in velocity. So even if the acceleration is parallel to the x axis, it does not guarantee that the change in velocity will be parallel to the x axis. Change in velocity does not equal velocity.",3,Student 27
"I'm reading this as net force implying that there are multiple forces acting on this box. Clearly the force pushing in the positive x direction is larger than any of the other forces acting in different directions, which makes the net force point in the positive x direction. Still, these other forces need to be taken into account, so even though it would be moving in a generally positive direction, perhaps the acceleration is pointing slightly upwards rather than being perfectly parallel to the x axis because of a small force acting upwards on the box. That's why I chose the last option-- even though the acceleration is positive, it doesn't mean that it HAS to be parallel to the x axis.",3,Student 38
"Just the acceleration is in the same direction of the net force. Because Newton's second law relates Acceleration and Force, the velocity of the box has nothing to do with the direction of the net force.",3,Student 37
"Only the acceleration needs to be parallel to the x-direction because Newton's 1st Law states that the acceleration points in the same direction that the force points. However, the velocity doesn't necessarily need to be going in the same direction as the acceleration. Both the velocity and acceleration would be parallel to the x-axis if the box is moving in the same direction as the acceleration and net force. However, it is also possible that the box's velocity is negative, and the net force and acceleration are positive. This scenario would probably be if you were stopping the box from moving towards you.",3,Student 40
"Since the box has a net force applied to it in the positive x-direction, the box will thus have an acceleration in the positive x-direction (parallel to the x-axis). Since the box has an acceleration in the positive x-direction, the box will thus have an (increasing) velocity in the positive x-direction (parallel to the x-axis).",3,Student 31
"The acceleration is parallel to the x axis as a force is being applied to the box in the x direction. If understand the concept correctly, force and acceleration work in the same direction. As such, acceleration would be parallel to the x axis. Velocity is not parallel to the x axis because a constant acceleration implies either an increase or decrease in velocity. As such, the velocity vector would appear at an angle to the x axis.",3,Student 3
Because the box is being pulled in the horizontal direction the acceleration will also be in the horizontal direction which is parallel to the x axis.,3,Student 36
"Using Newton's Second Law, we can state that a = F/m. Since force is being used consistently in the positive x direction and the mass does not change, the acceleration is constant and thus parallel to the x-axis. The velocity thus has a positive slope, given acceleration is the derivative of velocity",3,Student 22
"According to newton's first law, the acceleration is directly proportional and in the same direction as the motion.",3,Student 35
The force causes the velocity and the acceleration to point in the x direction,3,Student 32
"The acceleration will be parallel to the x axis because Newton's second law states that net force and acceleration have to point in the same direction. As for the velocity, I think its direction will depend on whether the object was at rest at t=0",3,Student 25
"The direction of the net force is equal to the direction of motion and therefore the direction of velocity. Since force is equal to the product of an object's mass and acceleration, the net force in a particular direction will give rise to a net acceleration in the same direction.",3,Student 30
