TRUE,Student 5,"The balls will hit the ground at the same time because, even though their horizontal launches are different, they have the same vertical force acting upon them, gravity, causing the balls to reach the ground at the same time.",3,"(1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)",1,27:30
TRUE,Student 30,The two balls hit the ground at the same time because they are both accelerating due to gravity in the vertical direction. The horizontal motion of the balls are inconsequential to the change in the vertical height of the balls.,3,"(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0)",1,27:12
TRUE,Student 56,"The two balls hit the ground at the same time because the vertical component and the horizontal component of the fall are independent of each other, meaning one does not affect the other. Since they fall from the same height their vertical components are the same.",3,"(1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)",1,01:05:43
TRUE,Student 53,"It's weird to think about in a literal sense but if you split the motions up into x and y directions it becomes clear they are moving the same amount downwards, so the distance travelled horizontally won't impact the time they hit the ground.",3,"(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)",1,18:47
TRUE,Student 89,"We know that acceleration in the y direction of both of the ball is -9.8m/s^2. In order to solve for its final velocity right before it hits the ground, we can use the equation vf^2 = vi^2 + 2a(xf - xi). For both of the ball, let's say: vi = 0 ay = -9.8 m/s^2 xi = 5 m xf = 0m As we can see from this equation, the only variables that matter are vi, ay, xi, and xf. The angle at which the ball get kick ball does not matter.",3,"(1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0)",0,31:02

TRUE,Student 57,"The constant velocity of the ball going upwards will be equal to the constant acceleration of the ball falling off horizontally. Because they are both falling from the same height, the angle and direction in which they are falling does not matter",3,"(1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0)",0,41:28
TRUE,Student 19,"I think that the both of the balls will hit the ground at the same time because their initial velocities, as well as their acceleration (g=10m/s^2) is the same.",3,"(1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0)",0,15:31
TRUE,Student 94,"Neither ball is thrown upwards, so gravity affects them both at the same rate. Therefore, they hit at the same time.",3,"(1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)",0,38:11
FALSE,Student 83,"The ball dropped vertically would only have the force aiming downward (gravity) applied to it. The one thrown horizontally would have a strong force moving sideways applied to it on top of the force going downwards, so naturally it will move horizontally more while the downward force acts gradually.",2,"(1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0)",0,34:31
TRUE,Student 2,"As said in the prelecture, if they are at the same initial height, they will hit at the same time. I think it has to do x and y being independent variables.",3,"(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)",1,18:53
TRUE,Student 79,"The x and y equations of motion, or horizontal and vertical vectors, are completely separate from each other. No matter how fast an object is moving in the horizontal (x) motion, its behavior in the vertical motion will remain the same. Objects that start at the same height will hit the ground at the exact same time regardless of difference in horizontal motion as they are both affected by the same constant acceleration (g).",3,"(1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)",1,41:01
TRUE,Student 18,"Horizontal motion is independent of vertical motion, thus the fact that the second ball is launched horizontally doesn't create a difference in vertical motion from the first ball.

TRUE,Student 25,"Honestly I thought of the example of the bullet leaving the gun in the pre-lecture video. Even though one of the bullets was being shot out of a gun and the other it was being dropped straight down, they're being dropped at the same height. Because of vertical motion and horizontal motion are independent of each other, and the fact that the balls are being dropped from the same height, they will hit the floor at the same time.",3,"(1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)",1,41:49
TRUE,Student 20,"vertical and horizontal components of velocity are independent of each other, and in these two instances, the vertical component is the same so both balls will land at the same time",3,"(1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)",1,38:31
TRUE,Student 100,"Since the first ball is launched horizontally, the initial velocity on the vertical direction v0y is zero, and thus the equation of the displacement of the ball in the y direction can be simplified as y=-1/2gt^2. Also, since the two balls are setting at the same height at first and are dropping/launching at the same time, their displacement in the vertical direction is the same. Thus, according to the equation of the displacement of an object in the y direction, we can know that the time when two balls will spend to hit the ground only relates to the displacement in the y direction and the acceleration of gravity. Therefore, the two balls will hit the ground at the same time since they share the same displacement in the y direction (the height is the same) and the same acceleration of gravity.",3,"(1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0)",0,22:50
TRUE,Student 55,"Both balls travel vertically to the ground. The second ball happens to have an additional horizontal component to it. Though the distance it travels is farther, gravity is constant and influencing both equally.",3,"(1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0)",0,38:45
TRUE,Student 61,"When a ball is being launched horizontally, its velocity in the horizontal direction is constant and its acceleration in the horizontal direction is zero. As a result, any two balls dropping towards the ground from the same height would hit the ground at the same time, since the only the vertical velocity and acceleration changes.",3,"(1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0)",0,24:51
TRUE,Student 13,"Both balls share the same values for vertical velocity, initial height, and they experience constant acceleration, or gravity. Thus, both land on the ground at the same time given that the kinematic equation for the y component depend on vertical velocity, vertical acceleration, and the initial height.",3,"(1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0)",0,54:11
TRUE,Student 16,"Regardless of the first ball's horizontal component, if they are both dropped at the same time they will both hit the ground at the same time because acceleration due to gravity is the same for both balls and only acts in the vertical direction, and they both have an initial vertical velocity of zero. Horizontal motion is not relevant here because it can be treated separately from vertical motion, which determines the time the ball is in the air.",3,"(1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1)",1,42:20
TRUE,Student 22,"They both have the same constant acceleration (-10 m/s^2) in the y direction, an thus will hit the ground at the same time.",3,"(1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0)",0,28:45
